  "short": "This individual's life began with a childhood in wartime Sydney and Tasmania, marked by early scientific curiosity, a love for music, and a fascination with language.  Later in life, they pursued a distinguished scientific career, becoming a Royal Society Fellow, while nurturing passions for music, gliding, and exploring the intersection of science, philosophy, and societal issues like climate change, all alongside a fulfilling family life. Their intellectual journey was characterized by a commitment to clear communication and a \"reverent agnostic\" perspective on the world.\n"
