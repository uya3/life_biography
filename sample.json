Memories of rock pools, ferries, and even oil slicks paint a vivid picture of a young mind absorbing its surroundings. These experiences were contrasted by periods spent in Tasmania, particularly at 10 Carnarvon Street, where simple pleasures like making mud and interacting with the family dog, Sidi, fostered a connection to nature and domestic life.\n\nA keen interest in how things worked manifested early on. Steam engines, a father\'s light box, and a general fascination with mechanics fueled a nascent scientific curiosity. This was complemented by early encounters with music, ranging from the grandeur of Beethoven symphonies on 78rpm records to the visual representation of sound on a father\'s oscilloscope, and the more formal setting of Miss Budden\'s school piano.\n\nThe acquisition of literacy was a pivotal moment, described as a "eureka moment" triggered by books like "Angus and the Cat" and "Pretzel." This newfound ability ignited a fascination with language itself, exemplified by the "Between the bars" incident, suggesting an early awareness of the nuances and power of words.\n\nThroughout these formative years, the father played a significant role, nurturing both scientific and artistic inclinations. Building model airplanes together and receiving explanations about the stars fostered a sense of wonder and a desire to understand the universe.\n\nFormal schooling began with kindergarten in Sydney under the tutelage of Miss Budden, laying the foundation for a life characterized by intellectual curiosity, artistic appreciation, and a deep connection to the world around them. This early period suggests a life poised for exploration and discovery, driven by a thirst for knowledge and a sensitivity to the beauty and complexity of the world.\n'}
