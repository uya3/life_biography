Professor Michael McIntyre,"Michael McIntyre was born on July 28, 1941, in Sydney, Australia. He came from an academically accomplished family; his father, Archibald Keverall McIntyre, was a neurophysiologist who worked on aviation physiology during WWII, while his maternal and paternal ancestors included scientists and early settlers. Michael spent his early childhood between Tasmania and Sydney, playing in rock pools and becoming fascinated by steam engines and mechanical devices.

He had vivid memories of living in a house overlooking Sydney Harbour, where he first became enchanted by music, especially Beethoven, played on his parents' record player. His early curiosity about sound led to experiments with homemade gramophones. He also recalled being fascinated by science from a young age—constructing model planes and asking questions about stars and physics.

Michael’s family moved to the U.S. in the mid-1940s, where he attended public school in Yonkers. He remembered cultural differences, learning experiences in American schools, and deep snow that delighted him. After a stint in Cambridge, UK, the family relocated to New Zealand, where his father accepted a university position. There, Michael completed his primary and secondary education, and his scientific and musical interests matured.

Throughout his childhood, Michael was a curious, observant, and often solitary child who delighted in intellectual exploration—whether via music, language, electronics, or mechanical systems. These early interests laid the groundwork for his future as an applied mathematician.","['classical music (especially Beethoven)', 'model airplanes and engineering', 'electronics and radio', 'language precision', 'fluid dynamics', 'science communication', 'self-directed learning', 'recording technology', 'astronomy']",70,"March 28–30, 2012"
