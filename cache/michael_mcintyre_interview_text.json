So about the time I was born he, I believe, was \nworking for the air force on aviation physiology.  His main career was as a neurophysiologist, \nso he had medical training and some scientific training in the medical sciences.  And through \nmost of the war I believe he was stationed in England, working at one of the research \nestablishments, and he had to do horrible things like – as a junior assistant, you know – get \non to a centrifuge and experience high  g  levels, because they were developing the famous  \ng-suit worn by the fighters that enabled them to turn more tightly and was obviously critical \nto the Battle of Britain. \n[Dead wrong on two counts: (1) g-suits were operational only late in the War – see the A.K.McIntyre \ninterviews  by his sister Anne Edgeworth – and (2) the centrifuge experiments he was involved in were \nmostly done in Australia, and he went to the UK only for the last year or so of the War, when I was \n“just three”  according to my mother Anne’s interview by Barry Wise, transcript page 6.] \n \nAnd what had he done before his war service? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 5 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n5 \nWell, he had a childhood... well, he was born in Edinburgh, if I recall correctly, because his \nfather was also a medical person.  He was a... he became a gynaecologist – my father’s \nfather – and was in Edinburgh, I believe, studying for his degree.  So my father was born in \nEdinburgh but shortly after that they moved to Tasmania.  That’s the, sort of, family home \non the father’s side: Launceston, Tasmania.  And my father went to a boarding school called \nBarker’s [Barker] College, which if I recall correctly is in the Sydney area. [Yes: Sydney’s North \nShore area.]  I suppose that was the idea of how to get a good education, you know, playing \nrugby and all that stuff, and they helped build the empire and everything they did in those \ndays.  Except that was a bit tough for my father ’cause, like me, he was heavily myopic, and \nso playing rugby was a bit of a pain for the poor bloke [laughs]. \n \nAnd he stayed a lot with my great aunt Molly  [Mary Edgeworth David]  during that time.  She \nlived in the suburbs of Sydney [Hornsby, near Barker College – more detail in her 1975 book \nPassages of Time: An Australian Woman 1890–1974], in a house that I know because... erm .. I \nknew her; she was the daughter of my [great] grandfather.  You see, I’m going back another \ngeneration, aren’t I?  On my father’s side – okay, my father’s mother [née Margaret Edgeworth \nDavid] was one of the redoubtable ladies of the time, a pillar of society, a feminist before her \ntime – and her mother in turn was the same thing.  And she – that was Cara David – she was \nthe wife of my great grandfather, Sir Edgeworth David FRS, who was a famous geologist, and \nalso went to the Antarctic.  He had his name on the South Magnetic Pole for a while, until \nthe wretched pole moved.  So there’s the luck of the draw in getting your name on things \n[laughs]. \n \n[0:03:14] \n \nI wondered how you know these things about family history.  In other words, when in your \nlife you discovered these things. \n \nWell, of course, a lot of it’s family folklore, but some of that’s on record because Edgeworth \nDavid’s life... I mean, he had a... his biography was written by his daughter, the same Aunt \nMichael McIntyre Page 6 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n6 \nMolly who lived in Sydney, and Aunt... okay, there’s that, and there’s also a book written by \nCara David, Sir Edgeworth David’s wife, Lady David, about their expedition to Funafuti, which \nis a Pacific atoll close to the equator.  I think it’s about eight south or is it two south, I forget.   \n[8˚31´S, 179˚13´E.]  Funafuti –  they went there to drill down into the coral to see if Darwin’s \ntheory of atoll formation was correct, which is a jolly good piece of clean science to be \ndoing. \n \nDarwin said, okay, why do we have atolls, these strange flat things on the sea surface?  \nBecause they started on something more substantial that used to poke out of the sea \nsurface but has become a seamount and sunk beneath the surface.  But of course the coral \nkeeps building, so it keeps the surface very near sea level where the coral can live.  And so all \nyou have to do is drill down to see if you...  how far down the coral goes for starters, ’cause if \nyou see coral a lot deeper than coral can live, you know that it must have been closer to the \nsurface once upon a time.  And finally you hit the rock and you’ve got the complete picture.  \nAnd I believe that Funafuti expedition was the – I think it was the first to do it, or perhaps \nthat’s just family folklore.  I’m not really a science historian [laughs].  [Chapter 5 of \nT.W.Edgeworth David: A Life by David Branagan (2005) gives a detailed account.  It seems that they \ndidn’t ‘hit the rock’ but nevertheless got deep enough to find coral samples strongly supporting \nDarwin’s theory.] \n \n[0:04:57] \n \nThank you.  And the life of your mother. \n \nMy mother [Anne] came from a family in Sydney that... and I know less about them in detail.  \nThey included lawyers and business people.  And her father, whose name was Keith \nWilliams, I believe lost a substantial... well, I don’t know whether fortune’s the right word, \nbut anyway he lost a lot of money in the 1929 crash.  Family folklore has it that he, you \nknow, was a bit of a stock-market... is the word ‘speculator’ fair?  I don’t know.  But anyway, \nhe lost a lot in 1929.  But they still, you know, lived comfortably [since luckily he’d had the good \nMichael McIntyre Page 7 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n7 \nsense to give my maternal grandmother a house as a wedding present, according to Anne’s interview \nby Barry Wise]  and they provided a loving and caring grandparents’ home for us.  [Further \nback in the family there was a famous settler, James Milson Senior, who was Keith Williams’ great-\ngrandfather and who after arriving in 1806 built his home on Milson’s Point, now at the north end of \nSydney Harbour Bridge.  See The Life and Times of James Milson by Roy H. Goddard (1955).] \n \nI very much remember a visit, when I was little, to them in Sydney... well... and then before \nthat...  [Here I think I must have been conflating fragmentary memories from toddler age with clearer \nmemories from a later visit at age 10 or 11 – still somewhat ‘little’.]  Of course I stayed there when \nmy father was away at the war.  So I think my memories of that place, which was in \nCremorne, which is one of the suburbs of Sydney that borders the harbour – it’s just at the \nnorth of the harbour, just to the east of the Harbour Bridge – Cremorne, a very pleasant \nplace – as kids we could go down and play in the rock pools in the harbour, and fish off the \nwharf, and ride on the beautiful ferries. \n \nAnd another memory I have from that time – and I think I must have been, well, heavens, \nthree, four, or five, or something like that [again, I suspect I may have been conflating or merging \nchildhood memories from a wider span of ages] – one of my memories is of the Sydney Harbour \nferries and their beautiful steam engines.  And I was fascinated by the steam engines.  You \nwouldn’t see that these days.  The engines would all be enclosed.  But in those days you \ncould, you know, lean on a rail and see the great pistons moving up and down and hear the \nchooff, chooff of the steam. \n \nAnd there was something called a triple-expansion engine – which was obviously a triumph \nof Victorian steam-engine technology – where the... that very hot steam went into a small \ncylinder and then it was passed into a middle-sized cylinder and then into a big one, to \nextract as much energy as possible from a given amount of heat.  Clever stuff, that. [laughs]  \nAnd of course Sydney Harbour’s a very beautiful place for a kid to be.  And I... you know, \nplayed with... well let’s see, I’m talking about when I was very little.  And I may be getting a \nlittle confused ’cause part of that time was in Tasmania and part of it was in Sydney.  \nBecause while my father was away at the war, I was... you know, we were put up in various \nMichael McIntyre Page 8 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n8 \nparts of the family, the Tasmanian part for a while.  And I have fond memories of that as \nwell, and the ancestral house in Launceston,  number 10 Carnarvon Street, and in Sydney \nthis Cremorne place. \n \nOh, and, gosh, another memory I have.  My maternal grandparents had a place out in Manly.  \nThat’s on the east coast of Australia.  You have to go out on the sea side of the harbour \nheads – I can look this up on a map.  I think it’s to the north [correct], but anyway, it’s on the \nsea coast.  And they had a place, I think it was just a little holiday cottage probably [or it could \nhave been their only home at the time], but I remember being there, and on the seashore \n[Manly Beach], when I was very little indeed.  And I actually remember – and heaven knows \nwhether this sort of memory is accurate – but I seem to remember learning to swim.  I was \nfooling around in the waves and I got the idea of doing a dog paddle [laughs].  [An unusually \nearly memory for me – perhaps that’s scientifically interesting in itself.  The powerful thrill of a \nsudden bright idea – and the even greater thrill of finding that it worked – laying down an unusually \nvivid memory from toddler age.  I also seem to remember that the idea came from noticing a dog \nswimming.] \n \nAnd the other thing I remember is oil washing up on the surface, and I was told this was \nbecause of the war.  You know, there were battles out in the Pacific against the Japanese, \nand when ships were blown up their oil tended to float around.  And I actually got covered \nwith some nasty sticky oily stuff, and I remember my grandmother having to wash it off \nrather laboriously [laughs].  So that was... I think I must have been two or three.  That’s \nprobably the earliest memory I have. \n \n[0:09:06] \n \nWhat are your memories of the Tasmanian landscape and... experience? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 9 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n9 \nWell, that’s difficult because, of course, I’ve been back to Tasmania on many occasions since \nthen.  And it’s a very beautiful landscape.  We’re talking in the Launceston area, of course.  \nIt’s the low-lying eastern part, not the highland part.  And, well, you know, you’ve got these \nrather semi-arid grasslands, often a yellowish colour unless it’s just recently rained, and, you \nknow, gum trees scattered around rather sparsely, and, you know, rolling hills.  There’s a \nbigger hill – mountain would be fairer – called Ben Lomond, off to the east.  You can just see \nit from some parts of Launceston.  So there’s this very interesting, you know, shaped \nlandscape.  I believe it’s geologically very old, but don’t quote me on that [laughs]. \n \nSo... but as a little kid what I mainly remember is playing in this, you know, house at 10 \nCarnarvon Street, where various...  you know,  my paternal grandparents  [who owned the \nhouse – a substantial house in red-brown brick with two storeys, a big basement, and a big garden \nincluding a hen run]  and various aunts and uncles would be in and out all the time and, you \nknow, there was a lot of loving family... this and that... heads [of sub-families, I think I started to \nsay]... I had a number of cousins there, some of whom I became very fond of. \n  \n[0:10:39] \n \nDo you remember what you did in the house, when you say you remember playing there? \n \nOh, just the typical thing that I would do as a little kid, which is play with... things,  but... all \nchildren are scientists at that age!  You know, we always love to experiment.  I remember a \ndelightful morning when I discovered how to make some very smooth mud.  You know, if I \nmixed it up very well I had a certain... must have had clay in it, I think, and I was fooling \naround with this [laughs] somewhere in the garden, and I remember the delight – the feeling \nthat I’d got it to this very smooth texture.  I suppose that must be like what a cook feels \nwhen they get the right pudding texture or whatever [laughs]. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 10 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n10 \nAnd then they had a pet dog called Sidi, which doesn’t... nothing to do with seeds, but it was \nan Italian S-i-d-i, after some war site in Italy, I think.  Was it Sidi Barrani?  I’m not sure.  [It \nprobably was Sidi Barrani – not, however, in Italy but on the north coast of Egypt.]  Anyway, Sidi was \na friend of mine when I was a little kid, and I used to... you know, we used to share bones \ntogether, so I got into trouble for that [laughs]. \n \nAnd, well, you know, I mean, I don’t think there’s... and, okay... I think actually I’m getting \nthe chronology a little clearer, because I remember toward the end of that stay in Tasmania \nmy father was back from the war and he made me a light box.  It’s a simple enough thing, \nyou know, a box with a sort of rotary switch that could turn on various lights, and the lights \nwere behind coloured windows, so as a child you could jiggle around with the switch and \nhave the pretty lights come on in different colours.  And one of the positions gave you a \nbuzzer,  just as a surprise.  And that kept me happy for quite a bit, I think [laughs].   \n \nAnd then there was a bit of rivalry because my uncle – one of my uncles [Tony Godfrey-Smith, \nAnne Edgeworth (David)’s first husband] made a light box for one of his kids, one of my cousins \nwho were living there, and I thought it was a better light box.  He made a fancier one, you \nsee.  So, you know, it’s all pretty obvious. \n \n[0:12:54] \n \nWhat I then remember is moving back to Sydney.  And this is quite important to me because, \nas I think I’ve told you, I’m deeply interested in music.  (I was even a professional musician \nfor a while, and I wondered whether to become a full-time professional musician, but that’s \njumping on.)  When I was a little kid I do clearly remember lying in bed – and this was after \nwe went back to Sydney – and we weren’t staying at the maternal grandparents’ any more; \nwe were staying in our very own house  [so to speak – actually a small house owned by the David \nfamily, I think; it was called ‘Haldane’ probably after John Scott Haldane, rather than his son J.B.S. \nHaldane], ’cause my father had got some sort of, I don’t know, postdoctoral job or \nsomething, or... I don’t really know.  He could have been living on a bit of family money.  But \nMichael McIntyre Page 11 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n11 \nanyway, we, the young family, my father, my mother, myself – and that was all, for a while: \nmy sister Margaret followed; she was two years later... so, okay, she arrived I think at that \ntime... [Wrong!  I forgot that Margaret had already been with us in Tasmania.  It was only our \nyounger brother Richard who was born when we were at Haldane. ] \n \nAnyway, we were in this little house in Hunters Hill, which is a part of Sydney that had a nice \nview of the harbour, and I remember seeing the rowing eights going past.  They used to \npractise there.  And... but the thing I remember most intensely is lying in bed and hearing \nthe music that my parents used to play.  They had a 78rpm  record player, and they had a \nmodest collection, a lot of which was Beethoven symphonies.  In fact I remember for a while \nthinking that the, you know, Fourth Symphony, the Fifth symphony and the Sixth \nsymphony... that was all there was, you know.  And everybody knew they were by \nBeethoven, so you didn’t have to bother to say that.  \n \nBut what was complete magic was hearing the slow movement of the Fifth.  Do you know \nthe Fifth?  [Hums music] Sorry, I can’t sing it in tune.  It’s a very beautiful, very, very simple \nthing.  I don’t quite know to this day why it’s so magical, but it was complete magic then, and \nit still is. \n \nDo you remember that house... ? \n \nI think I was about four.  I think I was about four then – I think. \n \nDo you remember that house clearly enough to take us on a tour of it? \n \nOoh... that’s a bit of a tall order [laughs]. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 12 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n12 \nIf not, a sort of partial tour? \n \nWell, perhaps a quick impression would be better.  It was kind of perched on the lip of this \nrather steep cliff that overlooked the harbour.  That’s how we got this wonderful view.  And, \nwell, we kids weren’t allowed to go to the bottom of the garden.  That was called Down \nBelow.  Don’t go Down Below, we were always told, because we could have had a bad fall.  \nAnd... I don’t think... I don’t remember much about the garden.  I remember, you know, \nthere were a few small bedrooms, a small bathroom.  The uphill side of the house [facing the \nstreet] had a little garden and it had a garage actually.  My parents had a beat up old wreck \nof a car.  It was all they could afford [laughs].  I remember, once, a fire got started in that \ngarage and there was a big panic about putting it out before the car’s petrol went up, but \nthey managed that [laughs]. \n \nSo... well, there was I in this little bedroom listening to Beethoven’s Fifth.  One other thing I \nremember: there was a bigger room, which of course had the view of the harbour.  I \nsuppose it was the living room.  And I remember we had this, you know, record playing \nsystem there with some quite big speakers. [Actually one big loudspeaker – well before the days \nof stereophonic sound!] My father loved music very much and he wanted to do his best to \nmake it sound well.  And another thing I vividly remember is, when he had the whole kit out \non the floor, he had the amplifier, you know, vacuum tubes glowing and so on.  This was still \n1944 or ’5, probably 1945, I think.  So there was all this amazing apparatus, the like of which \nof course I’d never seen before.  And he had the soldering iron there.  And he had an \noscilloscope that he’d borrowed from the lab.  He was already working on neurophysiology \nso he had, you know, all sorts of electronic measuring instruments. \n \nSo there was this oscilloscope with the green wiggly line jiggling all over the place while the \nsystem played Beethoven’s Eighth Symphony [hums music].  You know, marvellously life-\nenhancing, energetic music, the first movement of Beethoven’s Eighth.  And I won’t forget \nhearing that, and seeing the green wiggly line, and understanding that that was somehow \nsaying what the music was doing.  And I became very curious, how on earth did all this \nwork?  You know – how did they get a whole orchestra into that thin little disc?  [At that time \nMichael McIntyre Page 13 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n13 \nI had never seen an orchestra, but must have learnt something about them because we also had a \nrecording of Mozart’s wonderful K447 Horn Concerto, which I’m told I used to refer to as ‘the horns \nand violins’.]  What did the green wiggly line... how was it related to the sound I was hearing?  \nOf course I couldn’t have articulated those questions as a little kid, but I know that I became \nvery curious, and interested in playing with all sorts of equipment. \n \nAnd later on I remember my father helped me make an acoustic gramophone.  You know... \nso we had some Meccano bits and pieces and an electric motor; I think this was after we \nwent to America.  He went to America as a postdoc after that, you see, shortly after that.  \n[“Postdoc” is technically wrong, even though it was at that sort of stage in his career.  Because of the \nwar he never took a PhD.]  So we had this Meccano-type kit – it was called Erector in America – \nincluding a little induction motor with a gearbox.  So he was able to rig it up with the \ngearbox so that it would turn a turntable at approximately seventy-eight revs per minute.  \nAnd we made a pickup out of an old boot-polish tin with a paper membrane and a paper \ncone, so you could stick a needle on to the record and hear it quite well using this thing, \nand... which of course made me more curious than ever about how you could get an \norchestra into that disc [laughs]. \n \nSo I think that was the beginning of my being scientifically curious, you see, and interested in \ntechnical things, even though I ended up as a mere theoretician... you  know...  I’m just a \nhumble theoretician who tries to understand fluid dynamics.  But that was how I began, I \nthink. \n \n[0:19:13] \n \nWhat else do you remember doing with your father as a young child, perhaps in the Sydney \npart of your childhood? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 14 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n14 \nYes.  Well, the Sydney part... I was too young to have very systematic memories.  I think I \nhave more memories of that sort of thing in America.  We were in New York, in a house in \nYonkers, for about a year, I think.  I think this started sometime in 1946, again just from \nmemory, so probably ’46 to ’47.  [Actually a bit longer, well into 1948.] What I do remember \nclearly is there was a severe winter and we had deep snow that was about as tall as I was, \nperhaps four feet or something, and I was very excited by the snow, of course.  And the local \nkids used to play games of making patterns in it.  There was a little girl who lived next door \nwho liked to lie on the snow and wave her arms, and that made a pattern that she called \nbeing an angel, you can see [laughs]. \n \nThe other thing I remember, and this answers your question better, is that my father got me \na little book on making model aeroplanes, which was a beautiful book.  It was... you know, in \nthose days, well, you could probably get kits but they were probably pretty primitive, and, \ner... they may have been too expensive.  I know that my parents were very short of money.  \nThey were on some sort of fellowship that was funded with Australian money [sort of – see \nAnne’s interview by Barry Wise, transcript p 7] and the exchange rate with America meant that \nthey were pretty hard up actually and, indeed, my father always said that one reason my \nmyopia is so bad is that he wasn’t sure he’d got us probably nourished at that time.  And \nthey reckoned they weren’t properly nourished.  They would tend to give us, the kids, \npriority, of course.  But anyway, so, model aeroplane kits were probably out of the financial \nreach. \n \nBut he’d got this book which told you how to take bits of balsa wood and make your very \nown, just giving you the plans and drawings, starting with an extremely simple thing, just a \nstick with a rubber band on it so you could propel the thing, and wings that are simply thin \nbalsa sheets, not very efficient aerodynamically, but the thing flew.  I think that was called \nthe First Model. \n \nAnd then the Second Model was the next step up, which was the same stick fuselage and \nbalsa planes for the tail parts, but a properly cambered wing, which you had to build, with \nshaped ribs and spars and struts and things.  And on a, you know, drawing board, pin it down \nMichael McIntyre Page 15 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n15 \nand use aeroplane glue, acetone-based glue, the sort of thing that kids these days sniff to \nget high on, I think.  I didn’t know anything about that then [laughs].  But, you know, you’ve \ngot to cover it carefully with paper and stretch it nice and tight.  And then there’s a thing \ncalled doping, where you sort of sprayed a dilute glue on to it, and that tightened it more.  \nSo you’d make a nice wing and that would fly more slowly and stay up longer. \n \nAnd there were a couple more grades of models, ending with, you know, the proper thing \nwith a built up fuselage covered in paper, and a doubly cambered wing [oops: I meant \npolyhedral wing], very popular having these up-ended tips.  It’s funny, the jetliners have things \nlike that these days [well, a bit like that] for reasons of fuel efficiency.  But there it is.  So I \nremember that very well because my father, I think very patiently, helped me build these \nplanes.  And I was still only, what, five years old or something, so I think he had to do quite a \nlot of it. \n \nBut I think I learnt, you know.  I did learn to do it myself at some point.  And I remember \nflying these things and the thrill of seeing them performing in the air.  And I always after that \nhad flying dreams, and I always wanted to fly myself.  And I’ve actually ended up doing so, \ncomparatively late in life.  I mean, as an academic with a young family here – I had two \nstepchildren [oops, three!] – we had to be careful with money ourselves, although probably \nnot as badly as my parents.  But going flying wasn’t on the agenda for ages.  But finally I did, \nand that was a thrill too, you know, actually being in the atmosphere that I’d spent my \nprofessional life thinking about [almost feeling the turbulent atmosphere, through gliding in fact – \n‘flight without power’, as Philip Wills’ classic book called it – at the Cambridge Gliding Club, where I \nwent solo in 1990]. \n \nWhat were the flying dreams?  What did they consist of? \n \nOh, I don’t think it was anything out of the ordinary.  But, you know, you imagine that you \ngain the power of flight and you sort of – ah well, vaguely – flap your arms and you \nsomehow manage to stay up through an effort of will [laughs].  You can do that in dreams. [I \nMichael McIntyre Page 16 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n16 \nsense that there might be some connection with staying up in the water, as when learning to dog-\npaddle as a toddler on Manly Beach.]  I never learnt to do lucid dreaming, by the way.  It would \nhave been wonderful to do that and get some control over the whole thing, but I never got \nthe trick. \n \n[0:24:08] \n \nAnd memories of time spent with your mother as a young child.  We’ve covered time spent \nwith your father but what did you do with your mother? \n \nWell, she left the technical scientific stuff to my father.  Oh, if I may just say one other thing \nabout the time with my father.  I remember one night – it was a clear night – and he told me \nall about the stars and how far away they were.  And whether that was in Australia or \nAmerica I haven’t a clue.  But what I do remember is being absolutely entranced and \nmarvelling at... I was... I probably couldn’t quite grasp the distances, but I thought there was \nsomething awesome about the whole thing.  Those little... pretty little points, they’re really \nlike our Sun!  You can imagine [how mind-blowing I found it].  He explained that sort of thing to \nme, and the next time we had a clear night I said, “Daddy, please tell me all about the stars.”  \nAnd he was rather embarrassed ’cause he’d already told me everything he knew [laughs], \nbeing only a neurophysiologist, you see [laughs].   \n \n[0:25:11] \n \nAnd as regards my mother, well, she was a basically kind and loving and beautiful young \nwoman, who tended to be a bit restrained.  I think she always, throughout her life, felt a \nlittle bit dominated by my father [intellectually, I mean – my father was a gentle person and not \ndomineering in the usual sense].  And she had her own, you know, artistic activities.  She was a \nvery skilful painter and drawer.  She did beautiful portraits of us as kids.  Still kicking around \nsomewhere.  And... but, you know, as you might expect from that time, she accepted the \nMichael McIntyre Page 17 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n17 \nsocial norm, which was that you supported your husband in his career and you looked after \nthe house and the kids.  And I think sometimes this got her down a bit.  Sometimes she was \na bit short with us, but, you know, not in a – not in any serious way. \n \nYou know, what you learn about dysfunctional families... I mean, I was in some kind of \nparadise compared to that sort of thing.  Actually, I do remember as a kid, hearing some \nslightly more dysfunctional families screaming and quarrelling – and thinking I’m glad that \ndoesn’t happen in our place [laughs].  So there you are, we had a pretty civilised \nenvironment. \n \nWhat did you read at this age and slightly older? \n \nWhat did I read?  Oh, I think I remember the penny dropping about how to read.  This was \nprobably still in the Hunters Hill house in Sydney, in probably 1945 or so.  And, you know, \nthey gave us nice kids’ books with nice pictures.  I remember a book called Angus and the \nCat, and there was another American one – perhaps that’s after going to America – called \nPretzel.  Pretzel was a dachshund and [the book was] a sort of comic strip.  Angus and the Cat \nwas a standard book with pretty pictures and narrative, a few lines of text on each page in \nthe usual manner.  And, oh, I’ve forgotten what it was about, something about Angus, the  – \nAngus was a dog, he was a Scotty dog – and [about] having his favourite spot in the sun and \nthe cat taking it over, or something like that. \n \nBut what I think I remember is... I mean, obviously we got read to from these books.  And I \nthink my parents must have been reading and, you know, pointing to the lines of text, \nhoping that we’d get it.  And I remember a moment, a sort of eureka moment, when I did \nget it, and somehow managed to see what the lines of text meant.  Now how this happened \nI wouldn’t have a clue.  They must have done things that I’ve forgotten.  They must have \ntried to show me what the letters sounded like and that sort of thing, I expect.  We call it \n‘phonics’ these days, don’t we?  So there’s one memory. \nMichael McIntyre Page 18 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n18 \n \nWho read to you? \n \nWell, I think they both did.  Er... I really don’t remember which one did it more.  I wonder \nwhy.  From what I know of my parents, they would both naturally have wanted to.   \n \n[0:28:38] \n \nThe other thing I remember about my mother was that she was interested in, of course, my \ndevelopment, and that of the other brother and sister; I had one brother and one sister.  The \nbrother was born just before we went to America, my kid brother.  He was a baby in arms on \nthe plane across the Pacific, and all the passengers... he would be swaddled up with a big \nrusk sticking out of his mouth and all [one of the?] the passengers said, “Oh gee, he looks like \nWinston Churr-chill” [laughs]. \n \nBut... the... so our mother was interested in our development and one thing I remember her \nsaying... and I think she even put this down in a little notebook she wrote; she... at one point \nshe made a little book with some photos in it and her thoughts on this and that.  She called it \n‘Anne’s Book’. [Title page reads “REFLECTIONS / Anne McIntyre / interviewed and photographed by \nBarry Wise 2/10/89”.  The text is a transcript of the interview conducted by Wise.  My original copy is \nnow deposited with the Library.]  And... one thing, it had a little story about me as a kid.  There \nwas a playpen.  Heavens, was I small enough?   No, the playpen was probably my sister’s \nplaypen, I suspect.  [Assuming that she was 1 year old, I'd have been 3.]  Anyway, there was a \nplaypen, and there was a cat who went into it and my mother said, “Oh look: so and so, the \ncat, has just gone through the bars.”  And I immediately said, apparently, “You mean \nbetween the bars.”  So at that age I was already interested in precision in the use of words, \nwhich is perhaps a bit unusual.  And I’ve had a fetish about this all my life, as you know \n[laughs].   [According to page 14 of my mother's interview transcript, the words were more like the \nfollowing: \nMichael McIntyre Page 19 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n19 \n      Anne: “Michael, look at Pickles walking through the bars.” \n      Michael: “Through the holes you mean.” \nIt's interesting how my imperfect recollection of this story made the child's simple utterance more \ncomplicated.   I have no personal memory of the incident – hardly surprising since the transcript also \nconfirms that I was aged “between three and four”.  I was recalling only how I thought Anne had told \nit \nin later years.] \n \nYou know, just a thought that pops up from that:  I always marvel that science, and lucid \nthinking of any sort, gets anywhere at all when you look at the forces ranged against it – \nincluding the general sloppiness in the use of language.  And there are, of course, \nevolutionary reasons why our language instinct is sloppy.  It wouldn’t do to have automatic \nlogic-checking, would it?  You know, you can easily talk about self-contradictory things \nwithout realising it and, you know, some of them are even celebrated and put on a pedestal.  \nRussell’s Paradox, yes?  The barber who shaves only those who don’t shave themselves.  \n[And the set of all sets that are not members of themselves, and so on. ]  It’s always puzzled me.  \nIt’s flagged up as a profound  – you know – conundrum, or a profound something or other.  I \nsuspect Russell himself didn’t really think of it that way.  [He encountered it as a technical \ndifficulty in set theory.]  But, you know, people get off on all sorts of hype-ish trips on these \nthings.  All it is is a self-contradictory term, for heaven’s sake.  It’s no different from saying \nthat somebody has a ‘hairy bald head’.  But the thing is, it’s not obviously – you have to think \nconsciously – to realise it’s a self-contradictory term.  You know – okay – does the barber \nshave himself?  Oh no, the statement says he can’t.  Does he not shave himself?   Oh no, it \nsays he does.  You know... and by that time, you realise it’s the same thing [as the ‘hairy bald \nhead’ – i.e., yet another self-contradictory term]. \n \nAnd as you probably realise from reading these Lucidity papers [my published papers on \nLucidity and Science] ... and I get this from Jacques Monod, you see – Jacques Monod, whom I \nacknowledge, of course – he wrote this beautiful little book called Chance and Necessity and \nhe pointed out that there are all sorts of things in genetic memory that would have enabled \nour ancestors to survive.  And the mindless following of a great leader who gets up and says, \nMichael McIntyre Page 20 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n20 \nthe gods have spoken to us and, you know, “you’re either with us or against us” – and all \nthese George Dubya-ish sort of things – that’s just deep in genetic memory ’cause that’s how \nour tribes of ancestors survived and defeated other tribes in warfare. \n \nWhy did they have to do this?  Well, rapid climate change was one reason, wasn’t it, the \nseven years of famine and the seven years of plenty.  That’s a universal story, and with good \nreason, because we now know, from the ice core records and other things, that climate did \nchange enormously within an individual’s lifetime.  There were things called Dansgaard-\nOeschger events, where suddenly within, you know, a decade or two, you’d get a big climate \nchange.  So plainly the years of plenty could be replaced by years of famine. \n \nThe starving tribe members would have visions; a leader would arise and say the gods have \nspoken, you must follow me over them thar hills.  And that’s why the human genome’s \nspread around the world.  And I don’t think there’s anything particularly original about that \nidea, although I don’t think it’s as widely known as it deserves to be.  ’Cause when leaders \nget up and try and fool us with these things, it would be a good thing if more people realised \nwhat’s going on.  But of course, one reason they can [fool us] is that we don’t have this logic \nchecker.  We don’t naturally see through these bogus arguments and half truths and things \nthat happen politically, do we?  [Laughs] \n \n[0:33:30] \n \nThank you.  Your first school, do you have memories of your first school? \n \nYes.  I think it was in Sydney.  I don’t think I went to school in Tasmania.  So in Sydney from \nthe age of, well, about five.  That would figure, wouldn’t it?  There was a kindergarten, I \nsuppose, run by a lady called Miss Budden [sp?].  At the time I thought ‘Budden’ was the \nsame thing as a button, but never mind.  Oh, and I remember... well, not very much from \nthat.  I think it was probably a good school.  I don’t remember being terribly unhappy.  I \nMichael McIntyre Page 21 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n21 \nthink we were allowed to play and do reasonable things for five year olds.  But one thing I \nvividly remember was another musical experience.  They had quite a good piano there, and I \none day happened to wander into the room the piano was, and heard the most magical \nsounds coming out of it.  There was some, you know – might have been a young teacher or \nanyone, some older person, not very old, but they were extracting these wonderful sounds.  \nI don’t know exactly what it was.  It could have been a Mozart sonata, something of that \nsort.  And I was absolutely entranced.  I hadn’t realised that a machine like that could be \nused to make such wonderful sounds. \n \nAnd that sounds very stupid because actually there was a piano in the Cremorne house \n[though perhaps I’d never heard that piano played so beautifully], where I... now here’s where my \nmemory really is failing me.  I told you that... part of the war I was in Sydney at the \nCremorne house and at Manly, but it could be that it was only at Manly, and that Cremorne \ncame later.  This is the sort of thing memory does.  They don’t give you a reliable chronology.  \nThere was a good piano at the Cremorne house.  And now that I’ve remembered the other \nthing about the piano, it could be that I hadn’t encountered the Cremorne piano yet, or it \ncould be that I was at Cremorne and they didn’t have the piano there yet.  This I don’t know.  \nThe piano came down through the family in some manner that I don’t know.  It was a \nBechstein [grand], a pretty good one.  So there you are. \n \nBut the memory of hearing a piano [at Miss Budden’s school], a beautiful piano for the first \ntime playing beautiful music, that is quite clear, and vivid.  I don’t think I remember anything \nelse about the school.  Very vaguely, you know, kids’ games, throwing things around, \nnothing interesting at all [laughs]. \n \nAnd then – the next school then is in America? \n \nYou see, I think the reason was I wasn’t instinctively very social.  I was always a bit of a loner, \na bit of a maverick.  I was never into this thing that I’ve got to have friends, I’ve got to be \nMichael McIntyre Page 22 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n22 \npopular, I’ve got to have a best friend at school.  If I’d been that way inclined, I might well \nhave remembered more about the school.  So your next question, sorry? \n \nYes.  The next school then is in America, is it? \n \nHmm... \n \nPerhaps we ought to establish how long you were in America for. \n \nYeah, it was.  It was in Yonkers.  And I have more memories of that, being a bit older.  Okay, \nwe went to America, I think 1946 is correct, sometime in 1946.  My father... I remember the \nair trip across the Pacific in a Douglas DC4.  I remember one of the engines cutting out.  I \nremember looking out the window and seeing a stationary propeller.  The other three luckily \nwere still going [laughs].  And I remember seeing the wrinkled sea beneath us crawling – \ny’have t’remember in those days they only flew at, you know, several thousand feet, much \nlower than now.  So you could see the waves rather well and I was fascinated by that, \nlooking out the plane window.  I remember being airsick in the early part of the journey but \nit took, what, at least two days, I think.  We stopped at Fiji.  I remember the plants grasping – \nthere were plants that could grasp your finger, you know.  You stuck your finger there and it \ntried to catch you.  It thought you were a fly or something.  And we stopped at Hawaii to fix \nthe engine, so we were hanging around in – Honolulu, it was, for quite a while.  And then we \neventually arrived at San Francisco, and I remember being taken to a big play park with a \nhuge spiral slide.  And I remember being terrified of going down this, until finally I plucked \nup courage at the last minute, and then we had to go, and I wished I’d had the courage to go \ndown it before. \n \nBut I think we carried on across the continent, and whether it was in a plane or not I just \ndon’t remember [probably a night flight, with yours truly out for the count], but we arrived in \nNew York.  We went to this place in Yonkers.  My father went to be a postdoc [again, \nMichael McIntyre Page 23 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n23 \ntechnically wrong, but it was to do research at, almost certainly, postdoctoral level]  at the \nRockefeller Institute in Manhattan, with a man called David Lloyd, who was a famous \nneurophysiologist. \n \nAnd I went to school – to answer your question – at a school called PS16, Public School 16, in \nYonkers or near it.  And I do remember a bit about that, because I remember a rather \nstraitjacketed, sort of rigid way of teaching arithmetic.  We were doing little adding sums \nand that was something I could do already, but the teacher said you had to lay it out in a \ncertain way, you know, and I thought that was very tiresome because I already knew how to \nadd things [laughs]. \n \nAnd the other thing I remember about... I remember two other things immediately.  One \nwas that we had classes in what was called ‘ball’ and I thought that meant dancing, but \nactually it meant bouncing balls.  It meant ball skills.  And we had balls – we bounced them \nand threw them and so on – but we did it to music, so I think that’s where the confusion \ncomes from.  It was probably a jolly good thing, you know, coordination and such.  And I \nremember a little girl there called Virr-ginia, and she wanted to make friends with me and I \nwas much too shy to make friends with her, so I sort of... I think I was a bit standoffish.  \nThere’s my maverick lone-ish nature again. \n \nThe other thing I remember about the school was the American Oath of Allegiance.  Every \nmorning we had to stand up and face the flag.  There was a flag in the corner of the \nclassroom.  I think this goes on till today, doesn’t it?  We had to “stand up and face the flag \nlike good liddle Amerr-icans” and we, I don’t know, sang My Country, ’Tis of Thee, or one of \nthose things.  So that’s about all I remember, apart from the general fact that the kids were \ntoo forward... for my liking, you know, “hiya kiddo, blah, blah, blah”  [laughs]. \n \nDo you remember anything else of teaching and learning there? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 24 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n24 \nNo, no, not really.  I only remember the arithmetic thing.  I suppose we were taught to write \nsentences or whatever.  Who knows? \n \n[0:40:10] \n \nAnd where were you living while in America? \n \nWell, we had this house in Yonkers.  We were in... where were we?  It was a few rooms to \nlet, in somebody else’s house, a lady called Mrs Cipollini, who was... most of them seemed to \nspeak Italian in that neighbourhood.  I hadn’t a clue what goes on there.  But I remember \nhearing the sound of Italian being spoken, and there was sort of shouting at the kids in \nItalian and so on.  So... it didn’t... oh [laughs], well, I remember... Mrs Cipollini had a big son.  \nHe must have been in his late teens probably, mid or late teens, called Aldo.  And Aldo had a \nmovie projector, and now that was a treat, because Aldo had films of Mickey Mouse and \nsuch, that he showed us from time to time, and that was fun.  And I think I got on quite well \nwith Aldo; he probably loved kids. \n \nBut then I remember... oh, I was taught, you know, table manners.  I mean, one shouldn’t \ntalk with your mouth full and so on.  And I remember, as kids will, transferring this to the \nCipollinis.  I think – it was either Aldo or Mrs Cipollini, I don’t remember – I think it was Mrs, \nand she was talking with her mouth full and I said, “Mrs Cipollini, you’re not allowed to talk \nwith your mouth full.”  And Mrs Cipollini’s  response was, “Well, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet” \n[or something to that effect].  And [then] she talked with her mouth wide open and full of food \n[laughs].  I don’t quite know how she did that without it all falling out, but it made an \nimpression on me  [especially when she stuck her tongue out] [laughs].  But she was quite a \ngood sort, I think. You know,  it was quite a jolly sort of time in some ways.   \n \nAnd when you think of the Yonkers house, do you have sort of mental images of your parents \ndoing certain things in the house in certain rooms? \nMichael McIntyre Page 25 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n25 \n \nNot in detail.  I remember it was a suburban house and there was a fair amount of open land \nand trees around.  And that was nice for us kids ’cause we could go and play in the woods, \nanother thing you’re not allowed to do these days.  But, you know, we had fun, didn’t come \nto any harm.  I think I slightly made friends with a few of the neighbouring kids, or we played \ntogether at least.  I remember a great ice storm, you know.  We had a very severe winter \nwhile we were at Yonkers.  I told you about the deep snow.  But at some point there was a \nhuge ice storm that meant all the trees, which had dropped their leaves for the winter, were \ncovered in absolutely glistening ice.  That I remember – it was such an amazing sight.   \n \nAnd where is the next school?  Do you stay in America for a while? \n \nWell, let’s see.  I think we must have been there for something of the order of a year [actually \nmore like two years].  After that stay in Yonkers we spent a bit of time in uptown Manhattan, \nEast Sixty-Somethingth street, I think it was.  Somewhere near the Rockefeller Institute, I \nbelieve.  Because I think the Cipollini rental expired, and we had to find somewhere else to \nlive.  So... I remember this was the summer, probably of 1947 [actually summer 1948].  It was \nvery hot [and humid], as it often is in New York in summer, and I do remember lying not in, \nbut on, the bed with nothing on and still being too hot, and not being able to sleep very well.  \nAnd again the kids in the streets were, well, more aggressive, but I didn’t get into any real \ntrouble. \n \nAnd my sister broke her arm because she... she was always a bit more sociable than me and \nshe made friends with another little girl, and they got on to this swing.  There was a little \nplayground – there was a little courtyard at the bottom of this block of apartments, and she \nwas being swung up by this other kid and it got too much.  The swinging was too violent and \nshe screamed to stop, and then she fell off the swing and broke her arm.  So there was a \nwhole business about getting her to hospital and our parents somehow finding the means to \npay for this, ’cause of course that was a very expensive thing to do in America, and I think it \nwas a big worry for them. \nMichael McIntyre Page 26 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n26 \n \nThat’s about all I remember of that.  After that we went to England, and he had another \nyear’s postdoc – here in Cambridge.  [Again technically not a postdoc, and actually more like six \nmonths, according to the A.K.McIntyre interview transcript, Day 2, page 26.]  I remember going to \nschool here. \n \n[0:44:53] \n \nLet’s – yes, let’s come with you to Cambridge then. \n \nAlright.  I think that’s about it, because I can’t remember much more about America.  So we \narrived here and we had another severe winter.  And I suppose it must have been the winter \nof ’47–48.  [Actually 1948–9.]  You can probably check this in the met. Records – I never have \n– but a lot of deep frost and snow and stuff.  We stayed in a... one of those big houses in \nChaucer Road [No, Latham Road, one block further south], up in the attic, you know, in the old \nservants’ quarters.  And we had a terrible winter with us kids... I think everybody had nasty \ncolds and bronchitis.  I remember feeling very ill with something that was said to be \nbronchitis.  And of course the place wasn’t heated well enough. \n \nBut there was a gardener there, who worked for the owners of the house, who took a liking \nto us and made swings and merry-go-rounds at the bottom of the garden, so he was a lot of \nfun.  He let us tease him too.  He had this thing about lighting methylated spirits and saying \n“This is fairy fire,” you see.  And I was a bit too sophisticated to buy that, by that time.  I used \nto tease him and say, “No, no, you’re burning methylated spirits.”  And we used to smack his \nbottom as he rode his bike back up the road at the end of the day’s work.  That was Ralph \nthe gardener.  He must have been a very decent sort of bloke, I think. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 27 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n27 \nI remember being taken to a concert.  I remember being taken to two concerts in \nCambridge, on the back of my father’s bicycle – riding, you know, from Chaucer Road. \n[Latham Road!]  Do you know where it is, in the south of Cambridge, coming up Trumpington \nStreet?  And I believe it’s still got the same street lamps.  Do you remember the street lamps \nin Trumpington Street?  They’re sort of tall diffusers, probably with fluorescents inside them \nnow.  But I think they’re the same fittings.  They look terribly familiar.  So we rode up past \nthose into Kings Chapel [sort of] and I remember we heard the choir singing and it was \nsnowing a bit and it was rather beautiful, looking at the side of the chapel.  So that’s a \ndefinite memory.  [A.K.McIntyre interview transcript, Day 2, page 26 again.]  \n \nAnd I also remember some sort of audio recorder there.  That fascinated me, of course.  It \nwas... I think it wasn’t a tape rec... it was either a tape recorder or it might even have been \none of those old wire recorders, which is the same principle, but pretty low quality \nobviously.  So somebody was recording that concert.  And why do I remember it?  Well, of \ncourse, it was a fascinating-looking bit of kit, with these great reels full of tape or wire or \nsomething, enormous thing.  And I think I heard the rewind and, you know, on those old \nmachines you would generally hear the signal running backwards at high speed when they \nrewound it [makes gobbeldy-gobbeldy rewinding sound].  So I didn’t forget that. \n \nThe other concert was in the Guildhall, which again is [today] still much the same as it was, I \nthink.  And that was the first time I ever saw a symphony orchestra playing, as distinct from \nhearing a recording on a seventy-eight record.  And that was fascinating, of course, with all \nthese movements going on, the bows going up and down together.  That I remember.  I \ndon’t remember what they played though.  Probably it wasn’t familiar.  I was always pretty \nslow at music.  I always needed to hear something more than once to get it.  If they played \nsomething I knew from records already, I’d get it straight away.   \n \n[0:48:29] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 28 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n28 \nSo what else do I remember?  School, you asked about the school.  I went to Newnham Croft \nSchool.  I think it still exists.  I remember a bit about that.  Oh, I remember being taught to \ndo an amazing thing, which is add up pounds, shillings and pence.  Now there was something \nreally elaborate.  I don’t think I did know how to do that before [laughs].  So all this \nelaborate layout and all the funny symbols: pounds, ‘s’, ‘d’ and so on.  I don’t think I \nunderstood why pence was ‘d’ [laughs].  So... but... and I think it was, you know, a pretty \ngood school.  I think the teachers were kindly and helpful, and it seemed very well \norganised.  Sometimes you’d make two classrooms into one big room by moving a partition.  \nI don’t know whether you can still do that. \n \nWhat else do I remember?  I vaguely remember the appearance [of the school building].  I \nremember how I got there.  I had a little bicycle.  I had to get there and back from Chaucer \nRoad, didn’t I, so I had to get on this little bike and go down the alleyways across... did I say \nChaucer – no, it was in Latham Road.  I got that wrong.  We were in Latham Road actually; \nChaucer is the next door one [to the north].  So I’d have to go from Latham Road through one \nalley, across Chaucer Road, and then on to that green area and along the edge of that, across \na couple of [foot-]bridges.  There are two river bridges there, before you get to Newnham, \nand at least one of them looks like a miniature Sydney Harbour Bridge.  And I remember \nthat, of course, taking the bikes across it, helping my sister.  My sister was quite small then.  I \nthink we went together.  So, well, I mean, I do remember that, I suppose, because it was – \nyou know, took a bit of mechanical organisation to cope with the bikes and the bridges and \nhelp my sister along.  That’s about all. \n \n[0:50:37] \n \nAnd so as you were sort of getting to be a sort of older child, and approaching, I suppose, \nwhat we might call high school, what are you doing out of school at this stage?  In the same \nway that as a younger child you were making planes and, for example, making the record \nplayer, how did you occupy yourself as you grew up, as you became an older child living now \nin Cambridge? \nMichael McIntyre Page 29 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n29 \n \nIt’s a good question.  I probably... I’m guessing here.  I was interested in making model \nplanes throughout most of my childhood, probably up to, I don’t know, high school age or \nso.  Well no, beyond that, because when I was at high school – and that’s jumping forward to \nour time in New Zealand – we actually had a project to make a radio controlled plane, but it \nnever quite got finished.  So no, I was always interested.  So I may well have been making \nplanes.  But then again, I may not have, because perhaps they [my parents] couldn’t even \nafford to buy the balsa wood, or perhaps you couldn’t even get it, because that was only just \nafter the war.  Well okay, it was 1947–48 [in fact late 1948], and I think we went into ’49.  I \nthink we left Cambridge in ’49 and went to New Zealand.  I remember the boat trip. \n \nSo in Cambridge I don’t remember playing with either planes or electronics.  I’m sure I would \nhave been interested to do so if there’d been the opportunity.  And at some point I’d got \nmore interested in music.  But again, that’s another thread that runs through this whole \ntime, because obviously I was deeply interested in music from an early age.  I think it was \nabout when we went to Cambridge when I was given a recorder, as musical kids often are.  \nSo I was given a recorder, and a book with little tunes.  And I started, you know, composing \nmy own little tunes, of course, at first just for the recorder.  It could have been that learning \nthe recorder was... perhaps occupied my spare time in Cambridge when I wasn’t ill with \nbronchitis, or whatever else was going on [laughs].  The recorder – it was a black plastic \ncheapo [descant] recorder.  It performed quite well though.  You know, you could get all the \nnotes quite well.  Tuning wasn’t too bad.  And I think it was a made-in-England recorder.  I \ndon’t think you could get that sort of thing in America in those days, could you?  Probably \nnot. \n \nDo you remember what about, for example, playing the recorder you liked in particular?  \n’Cause you could imagine that one child might like – you could like a lot of things – but one \nchild might like playing it to other people and watching their reaction, and that... another \nchild might like, you know, hearing the sounds that it made.  Was there a particular... what \nwas the nature of your interest in it, in playing it?   \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 30 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n30 \nOh well, it’s the second of course.  As a loner and a maverick, I was never much of an \nexhibitionist and attention-attractor.  (I think my sole attention-attracting activities would be \nwhen I wanted something, and to get something out of someone [laughs].)  But no, with the \nrecorder my interest was experimenting with it and hearing the sound and playing little \ntunes to myself, and then thinking of other tunes.  So it was a rather... you know, solo \nactivity, if you like. \n \nYou’ve mentioned myopia a couple of times.  When did you first discover that you had \nproblems seeing? \n \nWell, my parents discovered it before I was aware of it, because – well, what they always \nused to say was that they were travelling with me in a bus or a train or something and I... \nand I was probably very little then – I mean, I may well have been three-ish – but apparently \nI pointed to a field with sheep in and said, “Look at all the puppy dogs.”  And they suddenly \nrealised I couldn’t see the sheep clearly.  So of course then they had my eyes tested and the \nrest is... I’ve worn glasses [or contact lenses, in middle life] ever since.  Of course that’s another \nreason I was a maverick.  I mean, a kid who wears glasses is always teased by the other kids.   \nYou know, you’re called four-eyes and, you know, they’re merciless – kids – if you have the \nslightest difference.  So... but... [that’s] perfectly ordinary [laughs]. \n \n[0:55:14] \n \nWhat did you do with your brother and sister as you grew up?  I mean, what sorts of things \ndid you do with them?  When not doing things on your own, what were you doing with your \nbrothers and sisters?  \n \nWell, again, the loner-and-maverick was the default, really.  They tended to play together \nmore than with me.  I tended to do my own thing.  And of course as a little kid I would tend \nto think of them as ganging up on me.  So I would get defensive about that, which of course \nMichael McIntyre Page 31 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n31 \nreinforced that situation.  But I didn’t mind, because I had lots of things to do.  By the time \nwe got to New Zealand [more accurately, somewhat after we got there] I was playing with \nelectronic circuits as well.  That took hours and hours of fooling around [laughs]. \n \nWhat do you remember of your parents telling you that you were going to go to New \nZealand, in other words, that you were going to move again? \n \nI don’t remember.  I think I just took all that for granted, you know, that we’d go wherever \nwe went.  I don’t think I understood much about career progression.  Of course, the fact was \n[that] my father had got his first permanent academic job – or potentially permanent; I don’t \nknow the exact terms of reference.  Funnily enough, it was...  there was a very famous man \nas Head of Department there at the time, Sir John Eccles.  He’s a Nobel Laureate in \nneurophysiology.  So I suppose my father must have thought, oh, that’s a kind of a Mecca \nfor... if I, you know, get an opening there I ought to go, I expect he thought.  Before that he \nmay well have thought about returning to Australia, I don’t know.  But there you are, he \nhappened to get that job. \n \nAnd that was in Dunedin, New Zealand, at the University of Otago, the oldest New Zealand \nuniversity, founded by the Scots settlers.  Dunedin, you know, means ‘Edinburgh on the hill’.  \nIt’s got all the same street names, Princes Street, Dundas Street, etc.  They’ve even got a \nlittle Scott monument in the centre of town, a little thing, about – I don’t know, it must be \nabout a fifth the size of the real one in Edinburgh [laughs]. \n \nAnd how long did you stay in New Zealand as a family? \n \nWell, okay, I seem to remember that we got there in 1949, and that, really, was my main \neducation from then on, until graduating with a maths degree [then taking up a temporary \nlectureship at Otago before going to Cambridge in 1963].  That was all in Dunedin [for me, that is – \nmy parents, brother and sister moved to Melbourne, Australia in 1962].   So we... I started at a little \nMichael McIntyre Page 32 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n32 \nschool called George Street Normal School, which was in North Dunedin.  (There you are: \nGeorge Street, that’s another Edinburgh street.)  And it was a decent school.  I think the \nteachers were, you know, pretty devoted, and strict but kind.  I think I’ve been lucky all my \nlife with schooling. \n \nWe lived in this house on the hillside that hardly got any sun, and that got my mother down \na helluva lot.  She... you know, being a good Australian, was brought up in a sunny... she had \na sunny childhood in Sydney.  She was born in Sydney.  So this rather dank and dismal sort of \nshaded house we lived in for several years – it wasn’t good news for her.  In fact we all \ntended to get colds and things, more than we otherwise would, I think.  But I suppose it was \nthe best we could do at the time – my father had a lecturer’s salary. \n \nAnd what was your mother doing while your father worked at the university? \n \nWell, she was again being a good housewife and looking after the kids and, you know, trying \nto paint pictures in her spare time [if any].  At some point she took up sculpture a bit.  I don’t \nthink she ever got into sculpture in a big way.  Drawing and painting were always her \nstrengths.  She learnt to cook very well.  You know, she helped with educating [entertaining, I \nmeant] my father’s colleagues.  They ran wonderful dinner parties.  Later on, when we made \nmore friends in the academic community, they would band together to put on super \ndinners.  You know, they had a sort of dining-club thing where, I think, three or four of the \nfamilies took turns in coming up with new dishes.  So I think that, you know, kept her quite... \nand, you know, they cared about good eating.  I think we always – you know, they did their \nbest to feed us well.  We probably ate too much meat.  In those days it was thought that you \nshould eat lots of meat.  But there you go, we had salads and vegetables too, you know.  And \nit all takes a lot of work.  New Zealand is, you know, very well off for these things, of course.  \nNaturally, ’re a lot of agricultural resources. \n \n[1:00:08] \nMichael McIntyre Page 33 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n33 \n \nAnd can we go to your secondary school, if… ? \n \nYes indeed.  Well, we had three levels.  We had the primary, George Street Normal, we had \nthe... what’s called the intermediate – I think this is a kind of system you see in other parts of \nthe world.  That, if I recall, would be, you know, age eleven, twelve, thirteen-ish.  Two years \nof intermediate school, we called it the First and Second Form.  We don’t have a complete \n[consecutive] set of grades; we start at ‘1’ again, at age eleven or so.  So that was the First and \nSecond Form.  It was called Macandrew Intermediate School, and I had to cross town to get \nthere.  I think my parents must have... you know, done quite a lot of hunting around for \nwhat they thought were the best schools. \n \nSo I went on the trams.  Dunedin had a very nice tram system in those days (which I was \ndevastated to see had been done away with, when I last went there [in the 1990s]).  But \nanyway, it was quite a pleasant tram ride and a bit of a walk and... this was... sort of more in \nthe western part. [More precisely, the school was about 5km south-south-west of our North-\nDunedin home.]  So I think it must have been about a three mile journey to school and back \nevery day.  And I remember my second year there.  There was a very strict teacher called \nMiss Foster, who was very keen on getting us to, you know, do our grammar correctly and, \nwell, do everything correctly.  And I got into trouble with the other kids ’cause I was quite \ngood at that, and so I was Teacher’s Pet.  And I gradually began to learn I’d better, you know, \nbe a little more reticent and not show off too much in class [laughs]. \n \nWhat was the effect of not being reticent, of appearing to be able in front of these children? \n \nOh well, you know how kids behave.  They resent it, you know, and so they tend to... they \ntry to bully you.  I remember suffering from, I think by today’s standards, mild bullying.  I \nmean, bullying can be a very serious problem these days.  We live in a completely different \nculture, full of brutal video games and heaven knows what.  I mean, we were free of that \nMichael McIntyre Page 34 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n34 \nwhen I was a kid.  So, you know, kids instinctively, you know, pick on other kids and try and \nwind them up and that, of course, went on, but I gradually learnt... this was the beginning of \nmy social education, I suppose, from a complete loner and self-contained, almost, to \nsomeone who began to understand a bit about how to cope with other people.  And the first \nthing I learnt was, well, ignore them and then they won’t stay interested.  Er... but, of \ncourse, it’s obvious where the resentment comes from when they yell “Teacher’s Pet” at \nyou, isn’t it?  [Laughs]  And...  Well, there it is. \n \nAnyway, I myself am grateful to Miss Foster, because I suppose it developed my sense of \nhow grammar works a bit earlier than most kids, or again, [more than many do] these days.  I \nnotice with my students, some know this [know some grammar] and some don’t know it at all.  \nI have t’actually teach some of them from scratch, ’cause they haven’t ever encountered it. \n \nAny teaching of science at this school, this intermediate school? \n \nI think – oh, now that’s a good question.  Did they have a science lab or not?  They certainly \nhad one at the next stage, at the high school.  But at the intermediate school – I simply don’t \nremember whether there was any lab work.  I suspect probably there wasn’t.  So... we may \nhave learnt a bit of science.  They had quite a good music department though.  I remember \nsinging in the choir there.  I still had a treble voice and I remember enjoying that. \n \nAnd any striking memories of the teaching of mathematics at this school? \n \nGood question.  I suppose – well, we were still in the regime where one teacher would teach \none class.  So if I learnt any maths it must have been from Miss Foster.  I can’t remember the \nname of the first-year teacher, though I vaguely remember it was a he.  He was a pretty \ngood teacher, you know.  I always quite liked my teachers.  Maths, maths?  Well, when did I \nbegin to learn maths?  Probably not very much then.  I don’t think we were doing much \nbeyond arithmetic. \nMichael McIntyre Page 35 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n35 \n \nOne thing I do remember is at some stage encountering Euclidean geometry.  And that \nwas... but exactly when that was I’m not sure.  And I suspect it mightn’t have [been at \nintermediate school]... well, I don’t know.  It might have been at high school.  What I do \nremember is suddenly realising the beauty of being able to prove something by an abstract \nargument.  You know, you have some similar triangles, or you’ve got a semicircle...  You \nknow, this beautiful theorem that if you take a semicircle and draw its diameter and any \nother two lines, that from the ends of the diameter [go] to any other point on the \ncircumference, [then] the angle is always a right angle.  “The angle in a semicircle is a right \nangle.”  That’s the way it’s often said.  Not obvious, is it?  I mean, you have to think a little \nbit about how the angles add up.  But the beauty is that it’s true of any such thing; it’s not \njust true of the one case.  So that’s the big imaginative leap toward understanding what \nmathematics is about, which is about abstract things. \n \nWhat is abstraction?  It’s the ability to comprehend many cases at once – usually an infinite \nnumber.  And this is an example of it.  So Euclidean geometry was, I think, my first, sort of, \nepiphany on that sort of thing.  And I think it was probably... first year of high school.  I \nmean, it’s difficult to be sure because I know my parents gave me, you know, some books \ncalled Teach Yourself this and that.  They gave me something called Teach Yourself Calculus, \nso I learnt a bit about differentiation and integration, I think before I encountered it at \nschool.  But that wasn’t as exciting as the geometry [laughs]. \n \n[1:06:32] \n \nAnd as you’re now becoming an older child, what was – what did you discover about the \nreligious views of your parents? \n \nOh, well, my vague impression was that on the whole they weren’t very religious.  But some \ntime after we arrived in New Zealand, they joined the local Quaker meeting, so I would go \nMichael McIntyre Page 36 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n36 \nalong to that with them.  I think it was driven by my mother’s... [concerns]...  She was on a \nquest for some sort of spiritual solace with her, you know, relatively restricted life.  And she, \nby the way, loved music, but not as much as my father.  So for my father, as for me, music \nwould be enough spiritual solace.  To me, music is the closest I get to the divine – and \nprobably for him too, I think – but for my mother, not quite so much.  So I think she was \nlooking for something else. \n \nI think what probably happened was she met some people...  of course, some of our Quaker \nfriends were very wonderful people.  So you get impressed, how these people manage to be \nso, you know, well, wonderful.  I mean, how do you put this into words?  There are people \nwho teach you that our species isn’t all about brutality and the holocaust and all those \ndreadful things that you read about in the news all the time... um... genocide...  it’s obviously \nin genetic memory.  But these wonderful people, and there are quite a number of them in \nthe Quaker movement, they teach you that there are people who think and feel and act \notherwise.  They look for “that of God in every man” and so on.  And-er... so I mean my \nmother was quite taken with that.  So I just went along to Quaker Meeting with them.  I \nnever really... I mean, I thought this was probably a Very Good Thing, you know, especially \nsince it’s all about not joining the war machine and all of that.  I think I quite liked that idea.  \nAnd so I sort of went along, but it never quite grabbed me the way music does.  I think \npeople vary, don’t they?  I mean, some people... it’s a kind of meditation, a Quaker meeting, \nand that does more for some people than for others, doesn’t it. \n \nYou know, writing music is my best meditation.  It’s the best spiritual exercise I have.  I don’t \ndo it as much as I’d like to, because it’s time consuming.  But getting into this almost trance-\nlike state and asking the music where it wants to go, that to me is – that’s the closest I can \nget to that sort of thing. \n \nWhy is it spiritual and not simply a kind of distraction?  Why do you describe it as a spiritual \nexperience? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 37 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n37 \nWell, what does one mean by spiritual?  What does one mean by spiritual health?  I think I \nmean things that make for a deep-seated wellbeing, something that’s deeply in accord with \nour instincts of... ah... goodness and wholeness, and...  [communion with, or oneness with, \nsomething greater than oneself, I could have added] ... difficult to put these things into words.  \nThe things... the life-enhancing things that are countervailing forces to ordinary brutality, \nordinary unkindness and competitiveness, ordinary greed.  Some of us think these \ncountervailing forces could be, you know, important.  I think they always have been. \n \nI mean, look how far we’ve come in a mere few centuries.  We don’t burn witches any more.  \nWe don’t panic at the sight of a comet.  It’s – it’s miraculous really, when you look at, you \nknow, human nature on average.  So these countervailing forces are real, and there are very \ngreat people who represent them and live them, and – you know, the Ghandis and Nelson \nMandelas of this world – don’t they.  And so you have to... I think there is such a thing as a \nquest for these things.  I’m sure my mother was on such a quest.  She was always... that is \nsomething I remember; she was always concerned about all this.  Well, they’d just come \nthrough the Second World War, hadn’t they?  They’d just become aware of the holocaust.  \nThey’d just become aware of the dreadful happenings in the Middle East that continue to \nthis day.  How are they... [unclear] ... would always talk about the Jews and the Arabs – how \nare they ever going to sort out this mess.  You know, so what’s new?  [Laughs]  So there was \nmy mother going to the Quaker Meeting, and... so I went along, but to me it was sort of \ngoing along, and not really quite feeling that it was getting to me. \n \nWhen you say you remember your mother being concerned about these sorts of – you know, \nsort of global or social problems, what are you thinking about?  When you think that she was \nconcerned, how did she show that she was concerned, by talking about it? \n \nShe could talk very intelligently about these problems  [more in her interview transcript, e.g. on \npage 9, “I feel... one of the most wicked things people can do is to bring unwanted children into this \nworld”]  as well as about artistic matters.  She was very interested in architecture, by the \nway.  She was interested in things like the Bauhaus movement  [and] in, you know, groups \nthat are trying to make advances in... well, what should one call it, artistic progress?  She \nMichael McIntyre Page 38 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n38 \nwas acutely aware that architecture is important for us, that if we have beautiful spaces to \nlive in and work in, it can make a difference.  And she actually designed a couple of the \nhouses that my parents later occupied.  I think that gave her a lot of... that was her spiritual \nsolace actually, more than anything else, I suspect.   \n \nWhat was your response then to religious instruction in school? \n \nOh, oh, the ordinary rituals, yes.  Well, of course we had prayers and hymns in assembly \nand...  our... well, at high school we always had an assembly.  It was a short address, a little \nbit of administration, you know, disciplinary stuff.  [And instructional hymns that we all took with \na grain of salt, e.g. “Teach us to rule ourselves alway [sic], Controlled and cleanly night and day” .  Not \nvery lucid – it took me a while to get the point!] \n \nWe had this marvellous headmaster, Bill Lang, who was a very redoubtable figure.  He was a \nvery good head, I think, but he was always, you know, standing up for law and order.  “There \nare always some fools,” he would declaim in assembly, you know, talking about some bit of \nvandalism or whatever it was [laughs].  And somehow, you know, we had a school with \npretty decent aesthetic [ethic, I meant] and, you know, barbaric behaviour was kept \nreasonably under control there, probably more than you could possibly do these days.  So \nokay, and religious ritual, that was a kind of  a routine part of it.  We’d have a hymn, we’d \nhave a short prayer.  We said the Lord’s Prayer every morning, if I recall.  We also had a \npatriotic song, you know, Men of Harlech or The Fishermen of England or something.  Later \non I used to play the piano for these things.  I got to be one of the school assembly pianists.  I \nwas never a brilliant pianist but I got just about good enough to do that [laughs]. \n \n[1:13:47] \n \nAnd so could you describe what you remember of the teaching of science at the high school? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 39 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n39 \nOkay.  Well, we had... our teachers... again, they were all pretty decent sorts, and they did \ntheir best within a certain, I don’t know, programme.  They had a programme of \nexperiments, simple chemistry and physics, you know, the usual sort of thing.  I think my \nreaction to it was, okay, quite a lot of that’s fairly interesting but, you know, I suppose I sort \nof... to some extent knew some of it already, from either my father or reading about it \nmyself.  And I think I remember being struck by, it’s all a little bit... it’s just a programme of \nthings to do, that have to do with science.  I don’t think I had a sense at that time of how real \nscience is done, how real research is done.  I don’t think many kids do, ’cause of course they \ndo it as little kids but it’s purely instinctive, you know, what... how real science is done, you \nknow you’re poking things to see how they work, you suck it and see...  [as a kid] you play \nwith, you know, toy guns and things. \n \nAt school, well, you can’t do it that way.  You’ve just got to go through a set programme.  \nYou’ve got to prepare for exams.  You know, the teachers... yeah, we had quite a jolly time \nplaying with bits of apparatus and... you know... but it wasn’t a big deal, really.  At the end of \nthe day it was about getting marks in the exams – even then [laughs].  So you had to just \nmemorise certain things.  I didn’t have any problem with it, but I didn’t find it hugely \nexciting, the way I did my father talking about the stars and how far away they were. \n \nWhat then were you doing out of school at this time? \n \nWell, I was playing with electronics quite a lot.  You know, vacuum-tube circuits.  Transistors \nwere... they were hardly with us.  They were just beginning to appear on the horizon, I think, \n’cause they’d been invented, but to be easily and cheaply available, that wasn’t so easy.  So \nyeah, anyway, I think I learnt some circuits, some simple vacuum-tube circuits, from some \n[two] older boys who lived down the road.  They were the sons of a local maths professor \nand they... they had the most amazing bedrooms or workrooms or something, completely \nfull of electronic components.  They were real geeks and had loads and loads of bits of \napparatus, and made their own radio receivers and transmitters, I think, probably illegal.  So \nthey showed me some circuits and gave me some bits and pieces and got me started.  That \nMichael McIntyre Page 40 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n40 \nwas when we were still in North Dunedin, I now remember.  [I think I was still attending George \nStreet Normal School.] \n \nAnd after that, well, I had a little bit of pocket money so I could go and buy a few \ncomponents myself, in later years when I was at high school.  I didn’t tell you, but we moved \nhouse.  We weren’t in North Dunedin any more; we moved to the south end, which wasn’t \nall that close to the school.  It was sort of the opposite extreme; it was up in the hills [Shiel \nHill, across the harbour to the southeast, nearer the sea coast], so I had this quite long bike ride to \nschool and back with a steep hill at the end of it, which was probably good for my health.  \nAlways had a headwind  [it often seemed], ’cause the [northeasterly] sea breeze would always \nmake sure you had a headwind, very often both ways [laughs].  [The prevailing southwesterly \nwinds tended to dominate in the mornings, and the northeasterlies in the afternoons.]  But I had a \nlittle bedroom by then of my own, and I could... and a workbench, and a soldering iron, and I \ncould play around with a few circuits – and getting electric shocks quite regularly because, \nyou know, [for] vacuum-tube circuits... you need a couple of hundred volts or so. \n \n[1:17:44] \n \nWould you  be able to describe something that you made at this stage, for an audience who \nperhaps won’t know what a vacuum tube looks like or how you, you know, do circuitry \nyourself?  But is there something that you could sort of take us through that you made? \n \nGosh, well... a vacuum tube, otherwise called a thermionic valve – we just called them valves \nin those days, um... well, the principle – that did fascinate me, that the principle... I think this \nis why I played with them, because I was just fascinated to look inside the things [and imagine \nhow they worked].  You’ve got this hot cathode... so there’s a little element [the cathode] that’s \ngot a little heater inside it, an electric heater, and it glows red – glows dull red – and it emits \nelectrons.  And because you have a vacuum, the electrons can happily fly off, if they’re \nattracted to some other electrode that has a positive potential.  Typically you’d have, as I \nsay, a couple of hundred volts on your positive elec... element. \nMichael McIntyre Page 41 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n41 \n \nAnd then there were, you know, variations on this theme, in which you had the element \nattracting the electrons – that’s called the anode – and in between you had sort of mesh-like \nthings, or sparse coils, which are called grids.  And the flow of electricity from the cathode to \nthe anode – under your power supply of 200 volts or whatever – that [flow] could be \nmodulated by putting a voltage on the grid.  And if your... the geometry of the thing was \nsuitably arranged, with the grid pretty close to the cathode usually, you could control the \nflow of electricity through the thing with a much smaller flow through the grid.  In fact, you \ncan even arrange things so there’s no flow through the grid.  You simply change its [average] \nvoltage.  You arrange for the grid to be slightly negative [on average] so that the electrons \ndon’t land on it very much.  But you can still modulate the flow past the grid by just \nmodulating its voltage.  That’s how you make an amplifier with these things. \n \nSo I understood that much, and I played with them, and made amplifiers, and that was fun \nfor a kid because you could take a microphone and speak into it, and have it come out \nlouder at the other end on a loudspeaker.  Simple stuff, you know, really rudimentary.  But \nactually feeling how it all worked, and putting it together and making it work, I found a lot of \nfun. \n \nWhat was the extent of your father’s involvement in this making at home of electronics? \n \nOh, I think I was pretty much self-sufficient by then.  He was interested, of course.  I mean, \nhe knew all that stuff.  He had to use that sort of kit for his neurophysiological research.  So \nI’m sure he must have encouraged me, and he probably explained the principles.  I’m sure I \nlearnt that from him, rather than at school.  They wouldn’t have had any reason to teach you \nthat at school.  So, yeah, I expect I learnt it from him.  He... you know, the sort of kit he used \nwas more sophisticated.  It would amplify a lot more.  You had to amplify tiny signals from \nnerve cells, in his work, and make them come out on an oscilloscope or some recorder. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 42 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n42 \n[1:21:06] \n \nWhat did you know then of his work? \n \nWell, not much, although he would take me in to show me his experimental kit, and I would \ncome in and marvel at all the bits and pieces in the lab, and... occasionally he’d show... doing \na dissection.  And now I’m going to get into trouble with the animal-rights people, because \nto do his sort of work you had to use live animals, if you [want to] measure what’s going on in \na nervous system.  He used cats mainly.  And he actually had quite a conscience about this.  \nHe knew that this was, you know... he loved animals, and cats especially.  We always had pet \ncats, and he absolutely loved them, so he obviously always had this feeling that... I don’t like \nwhat I’m doing, and yet I have to do it if I’m to get anywhere with the science.  And so he... \nyou know, he did his best.  He didn’t need any regulation, as we have nowadays, to show \nthat you minimise the suffering.  He would see to that himself, and he would, you know, try \nand  make sure they didn’t feel any pain.  This was all done under anaesthetic.  And usually \nafter an experiment you would sacrifice the animal because you’d had to, you know, open it \nup too intrusively.  But, you know, as far as the cat was concerned that was, you know, the \nway I’d like to die, you know, a sudden oblivion, no pain. \n \nThese days, of course, you have to go through a whole bureaucratic procedure.  I think it’s \nquite right, actually, that you need to justify the need for experiments on animals.  I’m, you \nknow, completely with people like Colin Blakemore who argue for it publicly.  Of course \nthere are some things you can do without animal experiments, and you should always try \nand do that, but my father’s work is a very good example of something you couldn’t.  And \nthere will always be some work of that sort.  So there it is.  I remember feeling these \nconflicting emotions myself.  You know, my father would always talk to the [experimental \ncats]... when they were conscious he’d talk to them and stroke them and pet them and try \nand see that they were comfortable.  So... \n \nDid you watch an experiment involving an animal? \nMichael McIntyre Page 43 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n43 \n \nI don’t think I ever had the patience to watch the complete procedure.  To do an \nexperiment, it was very many hours of intricate work.  And my father was apparently very \ngood at it.  I mean, his students always used to gasp with amazement:  “Oh, did you see him \ndissect that single nerve fibre”, you know.  I learnt this later when I was an undergraduate, \nand some of my fellow students worked with my father.  But I remember seeing an open \ndissection in the lab.  The cat was unconscious, and the electrodes... he used things called \nmicro-electrodes.  This was the new thing at the time.  That’s what he learnt in New York, I \nbelieve.  You draw out a glass tube to almost invisible fineness, and you can get the tip of it \ninto a single nerve cell.  And that was fairly new at the time. \n \nAnd why was he doing this work?  What was the... ? \n \nTo learn how the nervous system works – to learn how synapses work, how neural circuits \nwork, how receptors work.  How the... how is it that we can see?  How do... how do the \nphotons hitting the back of our eyes actually send signals to our brains?  Of course there’s a \nhuge ocean of unknowns, even today, in that.  But that was the aim of the science, to \nadvance our knowledge of these things. \n \nAnd, you know, when you think about something like Alzheimer’s disease... and that is \nsomething I think about, because it’s in my family.  I may get it.  It’s one of the cruellest \nthings that can happen, not so much to the person himself or herself, but to their nearest \nand dearest.  It’s very cruel indeed.  And understanding how that works, you have to \nunderstand how nerve cells work, don’t you, at a pretty deep level.  So I wouldn’t have any \nhesitation in saying [that] all that work is strongly justified, even though I’m not quite sure I \nhave either the ability, or passion, to do it myself.   \n \nWhat were your brother and sister doing while you were making circuits at home and \npresumably other things? \nMichael McIntyre Page 44 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 1 \n \n44 \n \nWell, they were a law unto themselves.  They played together.  They... at one stage they \nboth got interested in horse riding.  And I think my parents... this was when they were a little \nbetter off, of course, and they made... this was some years after we came to New Zealand, \nand after we’d moved to this place in South Dunedin where we had a bit of land on this \nhillside [Shiel Hill], so we had room to keep a few horses – two or three horses, I think.  I think \nwe had two actually.  Oh, we had three, at one point, ’cause we rented the space to \nsomeone else.  They [my brother and sister] learnt to ride horses.  And I think that was partly \nso that they would have something to do that I didn’t because... sort of... I was the... sort of, \num, favourite in a way, you know – being more obviously intellectual and promising.  So \nthey... ah... for my brother and sister it was always a little difficult having their own thing.  \nAnd the horses were one thing. \n \nMy sister became a very accomplished sportswoman.  She became a ski instructor, and she \nlives in Hawaii now and teaches surfboarding and... she’s also a Feldenkrais therapist, you \nknow; that’s all about bodily balance and so on.  It’s a bit like the Alexander Technique, \nwhich I’ve had and was very good.  Many musicians learn Alexander Technique.  It helps you \nto play without getting too tense.  But my sister’s an expert on all that sort of thing. \n \nMy brother became a surgeon, and that’s the way he’s earned his living, but he’s \npassionate... what he’s really passionate about is making wine.  He’s a medal-winning \nvintner, in Australia – in the Melbourne area, Mornington Peninsula.  There are lots of \nvineyards there.  He makes a wine called Moorooduc, which I don’t think you can get here at \nall.  It’s too small an operation.  It tends to get snapped up by the nearby restaurants and a \nfew customers in the region.  But he’s... you know, every time we go there we get fed these \nmarvellous wines, not just his, but anything else he thinks is good, and I always think he \nknows what he’s doing, even though I don’t have the judgement to tell really independently. \n \n[End of Track 1] \nMichael McIntyre Page 45 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n45 \nTrack 2 \n \nCould you say more about high school, in particular relations with other children at the \nschool? \n \nOkay.  I think my backwardness in, so to speak, social ability, emotional intelligence and all of \nthose things – I sort of gradually had the corners knocked off me, and learnt to deal with the \nmild bullying that I tended to experience.  I think I learnt how to be reasonably well accepted \nat school.  Part of this was doing sport, you know.  Now sport was quite a religion in New \nZealand schools at the time, and at the time I thought it was a bit tiresome because I wasn’t \nspecially interested in sport as such, nor was I specially good at it – which may have been in \npart because of my myopia, which stopped me from naturally learning ball skills and so \nforth.  So I never had any hope of being an outstanding sportsman.  But I learnt that to be \nsocially acceptable you had to have a bit of a crack at it, so I gradually learnt to be, you \nknow, somewhat competent at one or two sports. \n \nI wasn’t too bad at fives actually.  We played fives.  We had fives courts.  I believe there are \ntwo sorts of fives, Eton and the other one, whose name I forget.  I think we had the other \none.  There were plain... these fives courts were like squash courts with open ends, and you \nhit the ball with your hand.  And most of the time we played with tennis balls.  And you \ncould get quite skilful at this, you know, a bit like being... well, a bit  like sort of one-sided \ntennis, I suppose.  And there was a social side to it, too, because it was very much what you \ndid in the interval and at lunchtime: you played fives.  And there were different versions of \nit.  If there weren’t too many demands for the court you could play singles or doubles, which \nis the same as tennis singles or doubles or squash singles or doubles, I suppose. \n \nBut then if there were a lot of boys wanting to play, there was a game called Alley, where \nsomebody threw the ball up and called a name and... let’s see, have I got this right?  \nSomebody would throw the ball up, somebody else [the boy designated as “Alley”, I think] \nwould hit it and call a name, and the idea was to hit the ball in the direction opposite to \nMichael McIntyre Page 46 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n46 \nwhere the named person was, to make sure they couldn’t return it.  So that person was then \nout.  So you eliminated people and then there was an interesting late stage where a few \nwere left, and they managed to get the ball back a bit.  And I remember one day I succeeded \nin... okay, what happened?  I got picked on.  I was in the middle of this crowd of boys in a \ngame of Alley and one of the, sort of, you know, great sportsmen – the ones who are really \ngood at it, who’d hit the ball really hard – he [as Alley] hit the ball and called, “McIntyre.”  \nAnd he kept on doing this and kept getting me out, every time, until one day I managed to \nreturn the ball, by some sort of miracle, and we had a significant rally [myself and Alley, as the \nrules specified].  And I remember that was the point at which I became more socially \nacceptable [laughs].  I’d jus.. passed some sort of initiation test.  And I learnt to be, well, \nquite good at fives in the end.  I even got to the, I think, semi-finals.  No, I even got to the \nfinal, in my last year.  That was a bit of a fluke really; I wasn’t quite as good as that, but there \nyou go.  So I became socially acceptable that way. \n \nAlso made a few friends, who tended to be the more geeky boys, who were interested in \nscience.  I was very good friends with one boy, with whom I had a project to make a radio-\ncontrolled model aeroplane, because he had one of those little model diesel engines that \nyou can fly a plane with, and I had a bit of knowledge of radio and electronics, so I was \nresearching some circuits for simple transmitters and receivers.  But sadly we never quite \ngot to the end of the project, because some big exams came up and we both decided we’d \nbetter swot for the exams.  But I suppose that gives some flavour of my social life. \n \nThe other thing we did was in my last year.  A new music master came along, and decided \nwe were going to put on Gilbert & Sullivan.  Now that was a completely new and radical \nthing for this school.  This, by the way, is King’s High School, Dunedin, New Zealand, the only \nhigh school I went to, and...  Anyway, so all of a sudden there was this demand for musical \nthis and that, and I got the job of arranging this Gilbert & Sullivan opera for two pianos.  And \nI and my friend – who happened to be the radio-controlled model aeroplane friend, who \ncould also play the piano quite well – we played the two pianos in this arrangement.  We \ncouldn’t afford an orchestra.  But we put on... you know, it was a lot of fun... it was a great \nlearning experience, finding out what goes into putting on a staged performance like that.  \nWe’d got people making the scenery and one of the masters, who was good at directing \nMichael McIntyre Page 47 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n47 \nplays, did the directing.  The music master oversaw the music and trained the singers, and \nmy friend and I helped to train the singers.  You know, we’d go to their homes and take \nthem through their parts on the piano.  So that was all a lot of fun. \n \nIt was HMS Pinafore, by the way.  You know [half-singing], “We sail the ocean blue, and our \nsaucy ship’s a beauty,” etc, etc, etc.  And the boy who... and by the way, we couldn’t have \ngirls in the girls’ parts because schools were very much segregated.  This was boys only.  \nAnd... I think it was frowned upon to get the boys and girls on one stage together.  So there \nwas a boy singing the leading lady, whose name is Josephine, I think.  And she or he had a \ncrisis, because a few weeks before the performance his voice started breaking, so he started \ncracking up on the high notes, which was... and, you know, a lesser spirit might have given \nup, but with great courage he just carried on, and got through it somehow [laughs].   \n \n[0:06:28] \n \nThere was also, I think in your final year, a particular mathematics teacher that... \n \nYes – that’s right.  We had a new mathematics teacher [Gabby Haase], who was also... he was \nalso involved in the Gilbert & Sullivan.  He was part of a new stream of vigorous young \nteachers, new blood that had just arrived and...  he was... actually he was very good at \nseveral things.  One of them: he was a brilliant hockey player.  He brought the school hockey \nup to a higher standard than before.  But he was also a very able mathematician and an able \nteacher.  And he decided he was going to run a special class for so called Additional \nMathematics.  This was [at] the New Zealand counterpart of A levels.  And, so, you could do \nthis ‘Add. Maths’ subject, and take an extra paper.  And he took the class.  There was only \nabout six of us, but it was a wonderful new thing, in which all the class was intensely \ninterested in mathematics, and he played to this and got us all, you know, thoroughly \nstimulated.  He was very fluent at the blackboard.  He’d write things up quickly and he’d \nchallenge us to do things in our heads rather than writing everything down.  So that was, I \nMichael McIntyre Page 48 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n48 \nthink, quite influential on me.  And I ended up with pretty good marks in the final exams, \nand a scholarship to the university, where I did maths. \n \nAt this stage, just going off to university from having finished the equivalent of A levels, what \ndid you have in mind about what you might like to do career wise? \n \nNot a clue, completely naïve, no idea at all.  Except, of course, people did tell me, if you’re \ngood at maths, you won’t have any difficulty finding a career.  In those days it was easier to \nsay that sort of thing.  It was the years of hope after the war, and so on.  Everyone was on \nthe up.  So that was fine. \n \nAnd the decision to read maths, why maths? \n \nOh, I think it was just that you ought to do what you’re good at, and I seemed to be better \nthan average at maths, so... thought I’d go for it. \n \nCould we then have a sense then of your starting your degree and the sort of content and \nstructure of the first year? \n \nWell, I remember going to morning lectures.  It was the usual, you know, traditional thing we \nhave at Cambridge too, lectures in the mornings.  I remember we had some lectures at eight \nin the morning, that was quite tough for a sort of... eighteen-year-old, or whatever I was \n[laughs].  Actually my parents had the wisdom to see that it would be good for me to stay in \na student residence hall, a sort of counterpart of the – you know, the closest they got to a \nCambridge college – it was a place called Knox College and it was near the university [at the \nnorth end of Dunedin], and I think they forked out quite a bit of money so that I could do that, \nbut my father was I think by then a professor, so he could afford a few more things than he \nused to be able to. \nMichael McIntyre Page 49 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n49 \n \nSo I did all my undergraduate [studies] from Knox College and, when the parents were at \nhome, I would go out to our house at the other end of Dunedin that I’ve already described, \non the hills at the, sort of, south end of it, a place called Anderson’s Bay – well, Shiel Hill, to \nbe technically correct: Shiel Hill above Anderson’s Bay.  I would go there for the weekend to \nsee them, but spend the whole week in Knox College and go to lectures and make new \nfriends and do my homework and so on.  And I remember cycling down to lectures – to eight \no’clock lectures – in a tearing hurry after eating an enormous breakfast.  The amount of food \nI ate in those days is mindboggling [laughs].  They plied you with as much food as you could \neat, and I ate plenty.  So I had this enormous breakfast, and I charged down the hill on the \nbike, through the Botanic Gardens actually – must have been terribly dangerous.  And I sort \nof got to the lecture in time usually, and these were all lectures in pure and applied \nmathematics.  [And physics and chemistry.]  I don’t remember very much about them, except \nthat I found them quite interesting.  And I took meticulous notes, and I did study the notes \nmostly – before exams came round – so there’s nothing unusual about any of that.  Some of \nthe lecturers were better than others, of course.  Some had the gift of lucidity and some \nwere even entertaining – and others weren’t [laughs].  Oh, I did physics as well, of course, in \nmy first year.  It was maths, physics and chemistry actually.  I specialised in maths – I think I \nended up with nothing but maths in the last year.  [Last two years probably.]  It was a four year \ndegree actually.  I think that was a bit unusual in those times.  It was called Batchelor of \nScience with Honours. \n \n[0:11:40] \n \nCould you say something about the friendships developed during those four years? \n \nGosh – well, I had a room-mate in this college residential-hall setup.  Most of the young men \nlived in pairs... and it was pretty generous sort of accommodation.  It wasn’t on staircases \nlike Oxbridge colleges – it was, you know, long corridors – but the typical room would be a \nsort of small living room with a bedroom on either side; and that’s what we had.  And so I \nMichael McIntyre Page 50 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n50 \njust sort of... we had to sort of... it was a bit of a lottery really, pairing up with whoever it \nwas when you arrived there.  But I think I was lucky.  I picked, you know, a pleasant young \nman called Max Restieaux [or maybe he picked me], and he was a keen singer.  He was \ninterested in singing, you know, German lieder, and so on.  So we had some musical \ninterests in common.  And if I recall correctly, he was studying law, so we didn’t have much \nto talk about in terms of our respective studies.  I wasn’t specially interested in law, and he \nwasn’t specially interested in mathematics.  But, you know, we had a sort of... pleasant, \nchatty sort of relation. \n \nAnd then, you know, the social life of the college would typically involve getting together \nover coffee in the evening with... in bigger parties, and, you know, one would have \ndiscussions on science or politics or whatever it was, in the usual way.  And so I... I think I... \nyou know, one or two people I still stay in touch with.  There’s a guy called John Anderson, \nwho was, you know, intellectually interesting.  He was actually a student of my father’s at \none stage.  He was studying medical sciences – biology – and he actually married a girl whom \nI’d known in childhood. \n \n[0:13:46] \n \nI haven’t said anything about our holidays in the Southern Alps in New Zealand, have I?   \n \nAh no. \n \nBut we had this beautiful place in the Southern Alps, at the northern end of Lake Wakatipu.  \nLake Wakatipu looks like Loch Ness bent into an S shape or Z shape perhaps.  I think it’s a Z. \n[Wrong!  More like S.]  And at the northern end of that, there’s a little village called Glenorchy, \nand if you go into the countryside north of that, you... there’s a great big, sort of, alluvial \nglacial plain.  It’s got glacial terraces on it.  It’s flat but... a few terraces where the level \nMichael McIntyre Page 51 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n51 \nchanges suddenly.  With mountains all around, beautiful mountains all around.  The biggest \nmountain nearby is a double peak called Mount Earnslaw. \n \nAnd sort of tucked into all that topography there’s a little... beautiful little lake called \nDiamond Lake, and my family and a bunch of friends... another family, rather, called the \nMantons, they built together this hut by the lake, and we would go there every summer.  \nAnd this was when we were still fairly young kids.  And so... one of the girls in the other \nfamily I was quite fond of then, as almost a childhood flame, I suppose, to the extent I had \nany such thing.  Her name was Jenny.  She later married John Anderson from Knox College, \nand I’ve kept in touch with both of them.  Erm... so I don’t know how much more to say \nabout that... apart from it... \n \n[0:15:32] \n \nAny clubs or societies at university? \n \nErm, I wasn’t very big on those things... except for music.  I mean, I think my spare time \ntended to be taken up with music, because by that time I’d been studying the violin quite \nseriously.  I began to learn the violin at age about ten; I studied piano as well.  So I would \ntend to do the best part of an hour’s practice on each, probably not quite that much, aged \nten, but getting on that way.  So actually throughout my teens it was a pretty big part of my \nspare time, because by the time I got to the late stages of high school, it seemed clear that I \nhad more aptitude for the violin, although being able to play the piano to some extent was \ngood and useful in all sorts of ways.  But the violin was... I was tending to practise up to \nprobably two hours a day by then.  I certainly tended to do that when I was at university.  So \nI think that answers your question. \n \nQuite typically I would be doing a couple of hours of violin practice in the evening.  And at \nKnox College you couldn’t do that anywhere [anywhere you pleased], but luckily there was a \nMichael McIntyre Page 52 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n52 \nbig hall that was usually free.  I think it belonged to the School of Divinity or some associated \ndivinity school, and for some reason they had quite a big hall.  Sometimes, you know, the \nmaster of Knox College would call everybody to an assembly there, if there was something \nto discuss or announce.  But very often it was free in the evening and I’d just go and play the \nviolin there.  It was rather a nice acoustic.  So I think that’s why I don’t remember much in \nthe way of societies.  [I did, however, take part in quite a number of concerts, in Dunedin and \nelsewhere.  I was a founder member of the New Zealand National Youth Orchestra and was its leader \nfor three years.] \n \nScientific interests: I think they were probably satisfied pretty well by, you know, the \nlectures and the lab work, because I was doing physics and chemistry, in my first year at \nleast.  I think I must have been doing physics at least in the second year as well, perhaps in \nthe third as well.  I remember doing quite a lot of physics lab work.  And I was quite \ninterested, you know.  You had some serious apparatus to play with, much more so than at \nhigh school, so that sort of amused me quite a bit. \n \n[0:18:06] \n \nTo what extent did an interest or a focus develop through your degree, an interest in a \nparticular part of maths or a particular part of the sciences? \n \nI tended to be interested in whatever was lectured well, and within... well, for example, on \nthe whole we had better lecturing in the pure-mathematical subjects, and so my maths \ndegree was more focused on the pure side, even though later on I became focused on \napplied, and fluid dynamics especially.  But in a way it was kind of a good preparation ’cause \nit gave me a broader perspective.  I have some sense of broader areas of maths than if I’d \nfocused narrowly from the start.  I certainly couldn’t do much fluid dynamics, because fluid-\ndynamics lecturing was pretty much... well, it was either nonexistent or, in one year, it \nwasn’t very good [laughs]. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 53 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n53 \nI didn’t really get into fluid dynamics till I came to Cambridge to do a PhD.  And I did fluid \ndynamics then because it was a very strong part of the Department here.  And the Head of \nDepartment more or less told me, well, you ought to do fluid dynamics here: that’s what \nwe’re good at.  And I accepted that pretty readily, because I think I’d learnt enough to realise \nthat fluid motion is interesting and not at all obvious. \nI don’t think I’d yet read Feynman’s lecture on fluids.  You know, there’s a famous chapter, \nor there’s two chapters, in the Feynman Lectures on Physics. \n \nRichard Feynman is one of my heroes, of course.  I mean, he’s one of the people who \nexemplify what I mean by understanding something.  It’d be nice to talk about that later.  \nBut Feynman has written these legendary lectures in physics, he and a whole team actually.  \nHe gave the lectures, then the whole team of people knocked them into shape for \npublication.  But there’s – at the end of Volume Two, which is mostly a wonderful \ndescription of electromagnetic [theory], there’s two maverick chapters called The Flow of Dry \nWater and The Flow of Wet Water, where he talks about his wonder at fluid phenomena. \n \nWell, as I say, I don’t think I knew that until [after] I got to Cambridge.  But I think I already \nhad some sense of fluid motion being nontrivial, and a possible thing to be interested in.  \nAnd when the Head of Department said, “Oh, that’s what we do here,” I thought I’d give it a \nwhirl. \n \n[0:20:48] \n \nSo could you take us through the decision to move to do a PhD in England following your \ndegree, how... ? \n \nOh well, that was terribly simple.  That was just... everyone around me took it for granted \nthat going to Cambridge or, failing that, Oxford, would be the best thing to do [laughs].  And \nMichael McIntyre Page 54 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n54 \nI’d shown some talent, and our Head of Department in Dunedin – who was a pure \nmathematician and a very nice man, called Desmond Sawyer – he said to me, “Well, I \nassume... you know, all you have to do is just do your best in the exams and I’m quite sure \nyou’ll be going on scholarship to Cambridge.”  And that’s what happened [laughs].  And of \ncourse I knew a bit about the dreaming spires and the beautiful buildings, and so there was a \ncertain magic and mythology about it for a kid to, you know, want to go and see it and find \nout what it was like.  So that was all it came down to.  And everybody took it for granted \nthat, if you did all that, you probably wouldn’t have any problem having some sort of career \nafterwards.  That’s as far as it went. \n \nAnd you applied to the… would you have applied to the Maths Department, is that how it \nwould have been then? \n \nWell, you had to – I think – well okay, through most of my career here, you had to apply to \ntwo places, one to a college, and one to the university to be admitted as a research student.  \nI think it was like that [when I myself applied].  I remember applying to a college.  Somebody \nsaid, oh, the greatest college is Trinity, so you should apply there.  And my parents knew \nsomeone there and they said, oh yes, fine, why not go with it.  So I applied to Trinity and got \nin.  I didn’t do any shopping around.  I mean, knowing what I know now, I would actually say \nthat if you… you know, you might prefer a smaller college.  Trinity is such an enormous \nplace.  It’s got most of the Nobel Prizes and all of that, but it’s very big, it’s very rich.  If you \nlike that sort of thing, it’s fine, it’s a great place.  If you prefer a more intimate thing, à la C.P. \nSnow, you might go for one of the smaller colleges perhaps. \n \nOur present Head of Department, Peter Haynes, was a student of mine many years ago and \nhe’s always been a loyal Queens’ man.  Queens’ is one of the smaller colleges, and it \nobviously has a jolly good family sense.  If somebody asked me now I’d say, well, you should \ncertainly consider Queens’ – it’s a very nice place.   \n \nWhat then was the subject of your PhD?  What were you... ? \nMichael McIntyre Page 55 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n55 \n \nOkay.  Well, I came here and I – as prospective research students normally do – went and \ntalked to various supervisors and thought a bit about the projects they suggested.  Of course \nyou can’t really choose in an intelligent way ’cause you don’t really know what they’re like.  \nAnd there’s a… of course… I th… I think what really happens is if you get some vague feeling \nabout things you might like to do, and then the Head of Department comes and says, oh \nwell, we’ve got so many places here and so many places for this and that, and sort of nudges \nyou. \n \nAnd I think actually I got nudged, because there was a new young lecturer – his name was \nFrancis Bretherton – who’d just come and was looking for his first student.  And I think the \nHead of Department – who was George Batchelor FRS who was a very redoubtable figure in \nfluid mechanics, still greatly revered in the whole international community – well, George \nwas a sort of relatively young and vigorous Head of Department and he was keen to expand \nthe Department’s fluid-dynamical activities, and the reason Francis Bretherton had been \nhired was to expand into the so-called geophysical fluid dynamics area, which actually meant \nthen the dynamics of atmospheres and oceans –fluids flowing under the influence of Coriolis \nforces and buoyancy forces – which gives the whole flow a rather different character from \nordinary kitchen-sink flows. \n \nSo there was Francis.  And George sort of nudged me and said, “Well, Francis is looking for a \ngood student.”  You know, he was skilful, George, you know, flattered me a little bit.  So I \nended up working with Francis, which was quite an experience ’cause Francis was a very \nenergetic young man, exploding with all sorts of ideas.  In fact I didn’t quite know how to \nhandle working with him at first, because Francis’s way of working was to sort of do his \nresearch by talking at you.  So you had to sort of pick up what you could from being talked \nat.  We always used to say that, ah, you can always tell if Francis is in the Department.  All \nyou have to do is just listen.  He had this booming voice you could hear all the way down the \ncorridor [laughs]. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 56 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n56 \nSo at first I found this pretty confusing.  But I remember, you know, after sort of struggling \nwith it for a while and… sort of trying to have a go at one or two problems he suggested – \nsuddenly a few pennies dropping.  Because there’s a peculiar thing that happens when you \nmake the transition from being a bright undergraduate and getting good exam marks, on the \none hand, to becoming a creative researcher and exploring new problems, on the other.  \nAnd part of that – well, in my case anyway, I think I’ve seen this with other students too – \nthe penny drops that it’s no longer about just getting something right that’s more or less \ncomplicated; it’s also about paying attention to the very simplest things. \n \nYou know, the orders of magnitudes of some quantities, you know, how fast does the Earth \nrotate, or how long does the Gulf Stream take for a particle to get from one meander to \nanother.  And as an undergraduate schooled in sophisticated mathematics and group theory, \nand modern algebra, and heaven knows what – I actually knew what a Galois group was in \nthose days [laughs] –  anyway, [going on] from that you have to learn to respect what you \nformerly thought of as trivial things, very simple things.  And actually that’s something else I \nlearnt from… where did I learn it from?  I don’t know.  I suppose you sort of pick these things \nup listening to conversations. \n \nA very important part of a research group is conversations in the coffee room and playing \nwith ideas, and drawing things on the coffee tables and so on – and listening to other people \ngetting stuck on problems.  You have to realise that – you have to realise that you’re not the \nonly one who doesn’t understand things. \n \nThat’s actually rather important. I remember being in a fluid-dynamics seminar – and there \nwas a strong programme of these, there was a pretty substantial talk every week on a pretty \nsubstantial research topic.  And I remember sitting in a talk by a more senior research \nstudent, who had been around for I suppose a couple of years, and had done something \nrather complicated and sophisticated.  And there he was putting up these transparencies on \nthe screen, full of equations, all complicated stuff, and taking us through them much too fast \nfor me, so I hardly followed anything.  And, you know, feeling, oh, I’m never going to get on \ntop of all this stuff.  And when George Batchelor FRS pipes up from the front of the room, \nMichael McIntyre Page 57 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n57 \nGeorge says, “Len, Len,” he says to this student, “You’re going much too fast for me; go back \nand just explain that point more slowly” and suddenly I realised, hey, I’m not the only one in \nthe room who doesn’t understand this.  George Batchelor FRS is having a problem too \n[laughs].  And so that was actually very encouraging.  I didn’t... you’ve got to learn not to \nexpect to understand. \n \nThat’s the essence of research; you’re living your whole life as not understanding everything.  \nThat’s the thing.  You’ve got to try and live with the uncertainty, and [to] value, you know, \npartial steps towards understanding something.  And this comes back to this point about \nnoticing very simple things, ’cause sometimes understanding something does mean noticing \nsomething simple.  Oh, the order of magnitude of that quantity – it’s overwhelmingly smaller \nthan the other things we need, so I can actually neglect it.  It isn’t exactly right, but that \ndoesn’t matter.  It’s a jolly good approximation – so I’ll make some progress if I neglect that \nthing [laughs]. \n \n[0:29:50] \n \nAnd so how did you – having been nudged towards a particular supervisor, how then did you \ndecide what to study, or perhaps it was allocated, I don’t... ? \n \nOh well, I mean, as usual for a research student, the supervisor suggests a problem.  It can’t \nbe anything else, unless the student is a genius of unusual stature.  Very occasionally you get \nthat, but I wasn’t one of those.  I had to have a problem suggested.  So, you know, it was a \nslight variant on something that had been done already.  I think that was a perfectly \nreasonable suggestion.  A supervisor doesn’t want to load too much on the student.  You’ve \ngot to suggest a problem that’s pretty likely to be soluble, and yet has a bit of novelty so it \nhasn’t been done before.  That’s how you get started.  So I sort of ground away at a problem \nof that sort and, yeah, I got somewhere with it.  The results didn’t turn out to be terribly \ninteresting, but it made a bit of one of the chapters in my thesis, I think. \nMichael McIntyre Page 58 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n58 \n \nWhat was that? \n \nWhat was the problem?  Oh, this gets a bit technical.  But... now we’re talking about fluid \ndynamics. \n \nOkay, if you think about weather systems in the atmosphere, you’ve got these meandering \njet streams, and these cyclones and anticyclones at the Earth’s surface, and there’s a... \nthey’re all part of the same flow system.  And the reality is extremely complicated, and you \ncan’t hope to understand every detail of it.  But what is amazing is you can understand some \naspects of it.  And the way you begin to understand something like that is to, as it were, do \nsimplified thought-experiments. \n \nOkay, let’s imagine that there wasn’t any geography.  Let’s take away the land-sea contrast, \nlet’s have what people call an ‘aquaplanet’, nothing but ocean and atmosphere.  And then \non such a planet you can imagine that the flow could be just a symmetric flow around \nlatitude circles.  We do expect some sort of flow [relative to the planet], because the Sun’s \nshining, and it must be driving some sort of motion.  So... and I’m leaving a lot of stuff out \nbecause to give you the complete picture I’ve got to give you a whole lecture course on \natmospheric circulations [laughs].  But… one of the interesting thought-experiments turns \nout to be the following. \n \nLet’s now just imagine, somehow a flow around latitude circles has been set up from west to \neast, let’s say.  So it’s a bit like the real flow except it’s been straightened out to just go \naround and around latitude circles.  And I’m going to… now do a thought-experiment where \nI start that going like a great flywheel, and ask, will it stay that way or will it be unstable?  \nWill it develop eddies or waves or something?  And that’s a doable problem, and it’s that \nsort of problem I was investigating, or one aspect of that sort of problem.  The answer is that \nit is unstable if you give it realistic conditions, a bit like the real Earth, you know, such as \nMichael McIntyre Page 59 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n59 \nbeing warmer in the Tropics and colder at the Poles and so on, and rotating at about the \nright rate.  And when you do that problem you find it is unstable, and if you start with a \nwavy motion, no matter how tiny the amplitude, the wave will grow, like compound \ninterest.  It grows exponentially fast on a certain timescale, a few days in the case of the \nEarth, you see – remembering the typical orders of magnitude, part of understanding \nsomething. \n \nAnd then when the amplitude gets large, the flow tends to sort of wrap itself up into great \nbig vortices, and these are the cyclones and anticyclones we see on weather maps.  So there \nyou have already a piece of understanding, which says, even if you didn’t have the land-sea \ncontrast you would still have cyclones and anticyclones.  So the land-sea contrast adds other \neffects, but independently, as it were.  Or rather... or I shouldn’t say independently, because \nwhen you put the land and sea in then, of course, the cyclones and anticyclones have an \ninterplay with the land-sea effect.  So it gets more complicated. \n \nThank you, yes, that’s very clear.  And having started to do those thought-experiments, in \nother words to answer the question will it become unstable, in order to answer that question \nwhat did you do?  Did you... you know, I can imagine perhaps you sat at a desk somewhere \nwith a pencil, thinking and writing, or did you use a computer?  What did you actually... or \ndid you do something else, or make a model?  What did you actually do in order to decide \nwhether instability would be produced, in order to see that, yes, cyclones, anticyclones are \ngoing to be produced by these waves? \n \nWell, you can do this sort of theory on several different levels.  And of course I mustn’t give \nthe impression that I did all of that, because it’s a standard problem that people had thought \nabout for quite a time before.  In fact the first people to do a problem like that did it in the \nlate 1940s, and one of them was a man called Jule Charney.  Jule,  J-u-l-e – he’s often \nmisquoted as ‘Jules’ with an ‘s’, but he doesn’t have an ‘s’.  And he’s a very famous man in \natmospheric science.  He was one of the two who first did that sort of problem.  And he did \nit I think entirely without a computer.  There weren’t any [available to him] – when he did that \n– that was his PhD in the [middle to] late 1940s.  And I don’t think he had any computing \nMichael McIntyre Page 60 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n60 \nresources available, so he had to do it all with, you know, hand calculation, and tables of \nspecial functions.  It was quite a complicated endeavour. \n \nWhat I did was a slight variant on that sort of problem, which in fact arises when you think \nabout a counterpart of it in the laboratory.  Again, it was known since work in the 1950s, if I \nremember – beginning of the 1950s – that you could make a sort of simplified laboratory \ncounterpart of this problem.  Instead of the real atmosphere on an aquaplanet, you could \ntake an annular container on a rotating table.  So okay, you’ve got this container, it’s got a \nsort of... outer cylindrical wall and inner cylindrical wall.  In between you have fluid.  And if \nyou heat one wall and cool the other, you’re in a crude way simulating the tropical–\nextratropic[al], the pole-to-equator, temperature contrast on the real Earth.  And it does \nundergo a similar kind of instability. \n \nSo when you do this experiment you see a meandering jet stream, which is a little bit like the \nreal jet stream.  It goes wavy and parts of the flows wrap up into cyclones and anticyclones, \nand that’s always been considered very interesting ’cause you’re learning something about \nthe fundamental fluid dynamics in a simplified context.  So now... but what’s different about \nthe experiment is that these annulus... these annuli, these containers, are relatively tall, \nwhereas the Earth’s atmosphere [viewed on the scale of its cyclones and anticyclones] is very thin \nand shallow, and that means that the balance of forces in the vertical could be significantly \ndifferent.  You could get a lot more vertical accelerations as the instability arranges itself, in \nthe lab case.  And my first problem was to look at whether that made much difference to the \nresults. \n \nI see. \n \nIt’s what’s called technically ‘nonhydrostatic effects’ [laughs]. \n \n[0:37:52] \nMichael McIntyre Page 61 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n61 \n \nAnd in this circulating annulus, is it water that you’re using, or is it dyed air?  How are you... ? \n \nWell, you could use any fluid, but people tended to use water ’cause that was convenient \nand had... it was about as good a thing to use as anything else.  Sometimes people would put \nglycerine in, to make it more viscous, because you’d... it became a problem to understand \nhow viscosity affected these instabilities.  So that’s becoming more of a... sort of... idealised \nfluid problem – which isn’t especially like the Earth’s atmosphere, which [latter] has got a \nrelatively frictionless sort of motion.  But yeah, people... you know, when you start studying \na problem systematically, you want to vary the conditions [systematically].  And varying the \nviscosity was one thing that they did. \n \nHow did you go about investigating whether the depth of the fluid was important, by \ninteracting with this piece of equipment, this annulus?   \n \nWell, I mean, my aim was a relatively modest one, which was simply to do what’s called the \nlinearised instability problem – that’s to say, a mathematical theory that describes the early \nstages of the instability growing.  So when it’s beginning to be wavy but the amplitude not \ntoo great, you can do that with a simplified theory that’s easier to handle, for several \ntechnical reasons.  And you can do quite a lot of that just on pencil and paper; but in the \ncase of this problem, I had to use a computer at the end.  So that’s answering another \nquestion.  It was a combination of doing things on paper and a bit of computing as well.  And \nI did that on a vacuum-tube computer, by the way.  That’s how ancient I am!  The computing \nservice here was still running a vacuum-tube computer, not a transistor one.  It was called \nEDSAC II.  And by the way, that was one of Maurice Wilkes’s babies.  I expect he told you \nabout the EDSACs. \n \nHe didn’t personally, but other people have told me about interaction with it because it was \nused by the Geophysics Department as well.  Sometimes they were allowed to use it. \nMichael McIntyre Page 62 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n62 \n \nOh yes, everyone used it.  Some of my student friends were astrophysicists and \ncosmologists.  I mean, there was a wonderful guy called Malcolm Longair, who’s actually a \nProfessor of Astrophysics.  He’s in the Cavendish Laboratory here, and he was a fellow \nstudent of mine.  We flatted together, and Malcolm would come in – Malcolm was a sort of \nbluff Scotsman – and he would come in and enthusiastically say, “Hey! I’ve created anotherr \nunivurrse!”  And he did that on EDSAC [laughs].   \n \nI wonder then how you would describe your interactions with the computer in order to do this \nwork.  How... I know it will be difficult to explain technically and mathematically what you \nwere doing, but perhaps you could describe what you were doing day-to-day, in other words \nhow you’re sort of doing the day-to-day science of this. \n \nHmm, well, I’m not sure about day-to-day.  What I had to do was to get the equations \nworked out, that was the paper part, and try and put them into a form that was... well, first \nof all you’d try and find out as much as you can by playing with the equations and, you know, \ndoing mathematical things.  I... you know... it gets a bit technical, but you know, sometimes \nyou can prove you’ve got stability just by playing around with things called integrals.  But \nnever mind that.  So I would play with that sort of thing but in the end realise, I’m going to \nhave to go to a computer if I’m to finish with this. \n \nThis, by the way, wasn’t really heavy computing.  If there weren’t any computers, I probably \ncould have done it by hand calculation at the cost of, you know, several weeks of hard \nlabour, using things like log tables or whatever.  I mean, that’s what everybody did before \ncomputers.  In fact there were specialists who... when you talked about a ‘computer’ in the \nnineteenth century you meant a person, who was jolly good with log tables, and if you were \na great scientist you’d probably employ a whole team of these people, duplicating the \ncalculations so that you could check one against the other.  But since we had simple \n[electronic] computers, [such as] EDSAC, I could do that on the computer.  So once I had the \nMichael McIntyre Page 63 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n63 \nprogramming right, then it would take  a relatively short time, although very long compared \nwith today’s computers. \n \nSo then the problem was getting the program exactly right, ’cause one mistake, of course, \nand it computes something different from what you meant it to.  So I had to learn about \nbeing 100 percent accurate in programming the computer, which is not trivial.  So, well, \nthere’s a lot of day-to-day work, just working on that, and y’put something in and the first \nthing that happens is it beeps at you and says, “you’ve missed out a full stop, or something, \nand I [the computer] don’t understand this instruction at all.”  And then you get past that \nstage and then it gives you some numbers, which you can see are rubbish, and then you look \nfor whatever mistake caused that, and eventually you get that... [get it right], especially if you \ntry and compute things in more than one way, which I always try to do when I can.  In fact I’d \nnever believe a result of mine unless I’d got it at least two independent ways. \n \nSo eventually you reach the point where you think, yes, I do believe that result.  I remember \none time, when the numbers were coming out slightly wrong, and I couldn’t understand this \n– it was just in the third or fourth decimal place.  They weren’t, you know, withstanding a \nlittle consistency check I was doing...  It turned out in the end that actually one of the banks \nof vacuum tubes had gone wrong in the computer – so that one wasn’t my fault.  But usually \nit’s the programmer’s fault [laughs]. \n \nSo, I mean, you can imagine a lot of hours of work doing that sort of thing, and getting it \nright.  That’s [part of] why, you know, a PhD takes, well, three years at least, as a rule. [I \nshould have added that one also needs time to think around  the problems, to understand their \nscientific significance and their relation with other people’s work, and to begin to think up new \nproblems for oneself.]  I took a bit longer [than three years] ’cause I used a lot of time doing \nmusic.  There was an absolutely wonderful crowd of musicians at Cambridge; I don’t know \nwhether you want to talk about that now. \n \n[0:43:50] \nMichael McIntyre Page 64 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n64 \n \nWell, just in a second.  But I wonder first whether you could tell me about your memories of \nmembers of that Department, the Department in which you were doing your PhD, the sorts \nof things you could tell us about the scientists working there that might not be obvious from \nobituaries or from other accounts.  But you will have met, you know, not just your supervisor \nbut other senior scientists there. \n \nWell, I think the bottom line is you pick up things from listening to people talking at coffee or \nwhatever.  You get a sense of what kinds of mathematical tools they use, and they find \nimportant.  And most of this, by the way, were things I had not learned as an undergraduate.  \nI told you I did mostly pure mathematics as an undergraduate.  So some pretty standard \ntechniques in applied mathematics I didn’t know about, so I had to pick up that people were \nusing them.  I remember Francis Bretherton with his booming voice talking to somebody else \nabout – oh yeah, that problem, yeah, well look, what you want to do is you want to set up \nthis and that, and then you want to “do the asymptotics.”  And later I learnt [that] that was \nan absolutely bogstandard thing, it just means you consider how the equations simplify \nwhen you let some parameter, some number, go to a limiting value – very small or very \nlarge.  And it’s a very, very standard way to simplify things so you can get some sort of \nhandle on what’s going on. \n \nI mean, I would now tell my students a complete understanding of one of these problems \nconsists in doing what you can with the equations on paper, and looking at the asymptotics – \nthat’s looking at the limiting cases where, with luck, some of the cases will be simple enough \nto solve completely by hand, with a simple formula even, if you’re really lucky – but then to \ndo all the in-between cases, where the parameters take more general values; they’d \nprobably have to use a computer.  And by the time you’ve done all that, you’ve kind of got \nthe extreme cases and the intermediate ones, and you’ve got some sort of grip on the whole \nproblem.  So I was picking up things like that for the first time, in my first year. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 65 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n65 \nAnd also of course, you know, noticing the personalities round the place [to come to your \nquestion.].  One of them was Fred Hoyle.  You know, Fred Hoyle was still a membe r of \nthe Department then.  This was before the great fall[ing] out between Fred Hoyle and \nGeorge Batchelor, where they both wanted to be Head of Department, and of course had \nvery different ideas what they wanted to do with it.  If Fred had won, then of course we \nwouldn’t have any geophysical fluid dynamics at all, and my career would have been slightly \ndifferent – if I’d had any sort of career [laughs].  Probably would have been somewhere in \nAmerica.  But there you go.  But, you know, Fred... it was interesting to see the legendary \nFred Hoyle around.  I think I’d read his Frontiers of Astronomy, or something like that, when I \nwas young.   \n \nWhat was he like as a sort of character,  just as a person? \n \nOh, you know, Fred, sort of the bluff Yorkshireman, “you knaw, aw, what! that’s a lawd of \nnonsense, you knaw”… I…  Actually, Fred... [laughs] it’s interesting about Fred.  He was a \nbrilliant creative thinker, and yet he would also go completely off the rails.  I mean, if you’ve \never read any of his sci-fi books – the Black Cloud is a good example – his whole idea is this \ncomic-strip idea of the great scientist who does everything himself.  I think Fred... that was \nFred’s own image of himself, you know [laughs]… cracks the entire problem single handed.  \nIt’s not how things really work, hardly ever.  And even, you know, the greatest of scientists, \npeople like Feynman, would tell you that. \n \nBut what was I going to... Fred... well, I’ll tell you one thing about Fred.  Later on in my career \nI noticed that he’d been saying things about the stratosphere – the Earth’s stratosphere.  He \nwanted the flow in the stratosphere to be of a certain kind, to fit his theory of  ‘panspermia’,  \nyou see.  It’s all about how viruses get here from space, and ’flu epidemics are all to do with \nviruses coming down through the stratosphere from somewhere or other [laughs].  And, you \nknow, he had his reasons for this theory, which I actually... well, lemme not... I don’t really \nthink anyone takes that seriously now.  [We now have much deeper and more detailed insight \ninto the workings of natural selection and molecular biology – which I, for one, would say makes \nnonsense of Fred’s then line of argument.]  But the thing about Fred is he did [seem to] have this \nMichael McIntyre Page 66 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n66 \nidea of doing everything himself.  So, with the stratosphere, he didn’t actually bother to look \nat what people had observed was going on in the real stratosphere!  He just got some idea \nabout it, which is the flow – it’s actually this flow around latitude circles I was talking about.  \nHe thought the stratosphere really was like that, and nothing much [else] was happening up \nthere.  And we know perfectly well that’s wrong [laughs].  A lot of my career was getting a \nbetter handle on what really is happening in the stratosphere, and what the fluid dynamics is \nlike. \n \nBut anyway, there was Fred, who thought it was, you know, just flow around latitude circles.  \nAnd I once actually met him and tried to tell him what the real stratosphere was like but I \ndon’t think he was very receptive [laughs].  I don’t remember very much about that.  But I do \nremember talking to Hermann Bondi, who was famously a collaborator of Fred’s, you know.  \nThere’s a very famous paper by Bondi, Gold and Hoyle, or Bondi, Hoyle and Gold, in some \norder, that proposed what’s called the steady-state theory of the universe.  And at the time \nthat was a perfectly good piece of theoretical science because, you know, they wanted a \npicture of the universe in which you could understand that the galaxies are receding as we... \nwhich is seen to be the only sensible interpretation of the observed redshifts – and yet the \nuniverse was in a steady state [their theory said].  It wasn’t something that went from a Big \nBang, as we now all believe.  In fact, Fred invented the term ‘Big Bang’.  Did you know that?  \nFred... you see, the radio astronomers – and Malcolm Longair, whom I mentioned before, \nwas in that Department [the Cavendish Laboratory’s radio-astronomy group under Martin Ryle] – \nso I learnt quite a bit about this when I was a research student.  And, you know, they \nobserve these redshifts and [have] these pictures of galaxies receding and the universe \nexpanding, and that was just building on what Hubble had done before. \n \nAnd so some people thought, oh well, there must have been something like a Big Bang.  But \nthat wasn’t called that till Fred called it the Big Bang.  And he regarded it as a term of \nderision.  Oh, this silly Big Bang, you know.  A much better theory [he felt] would be to say it’s \nall in a steady state, and matter is being continuously created to fill the voids between the \nretreating galaxies.  And that was a perfectly good thing to suggest because it was testable.  \nAnd it was tested, and found not to fit the observations.  So that’s [part of] why we believe in \nMichael McIntyre Page 67 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n67 \nthe Big Bang now, which does fit, in quite a lot of detail, with various recent modifications \nthat have gone on – dark ‘energy’ and all that stuff [laughs]. \n \nBut I remember Bondi... Bondi – I don’t suppose you ever heard Hermann Bondi lecture?  He \nwas – well, in a way he’s another of my heroes.  He was a brilliant man, a brilliant thinker \nand a brilliant lecturer, who very much exemplified what I call ‘lucidity principles’.  He was \nnot only lucid – absolutely – you know, no needless words [or gratuitous variations], every \nword pointing clearly to what he was trying to say – but also very entertaining [laughs].  \nThere’s some published lectures of his called the – I think it’s the Tanner lectures [actually the \n1965 Tarner Lectures, published by Cambridge in 1967] – called Assumption and Myth in Physical \nTheory, which I recommend t’anybody who’s at all interested in science, and...  He, er, \n[unintelligible] lots of wonderful things to say about, you know, both scientific progress and \nmythology – things that people believe without their being really justified –  and how to \nunderstand things better.  It was wonderful stuff. \n \nBut anyway, I once or twice had a chance to chat to Bondi, and I asked about Hoyle, once.  \n[Trying to imitate Bondi’s Viennese accent:]  “Ah Frred,” he said... uh...  “Fred – a brrilliant mind.    \nBut he needed me to get him back on to the rrails.” [Laughs] ...  Well, there’s a digression for \nyou. \n \nThat’s wonderful, thank you. \n \nBut you asked me about personalities, you see, around the Department, so there it is.  At the \ntime, he [Hoyle] was working with Jayant Narlikar on the steady-state theory.  They were, \nyou know, trying to refine it so it would withstand all these new observations, but they had \nto give up in the end, because it got too artificial.  I remember Narlikar writing a paper which \nsaid, oh well, the whole thing’s really in a steady state, but we’re living in just a ‘bubble’ that \nhappens to be expanding [laughs]. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 68 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n68 \n[0:52:51] \n \nAnd so how then did your PhD progress?   \n \nWell, not fast enough at first, ’cause I got into this crowd of musicians [laughs]. \n \nOh yes, tell us about that. \n   \nWell, this was a wonderful thing, and I wouldn’t have missed it for the world.  There were, in \nthe... student musical circles – and this is when I did get into student societies –  there was \nsomething called the Music Club, and there was the Cambridge University Music Society.  I \nwas mainly involved in the Music Club, which ran chamber music concerts every weekend, \nand I played in quite a number of those.  I was quite an accomplished violinist by then, \nhaving – doing all this practice in the evenings when I was an undergraduate [laughs].  And \nplaying in the New Zealand National Youth Orchestra, by the way.  I got to be leader of that.  \nSo I had quite a bit of encouragement as a musician.  I suppose that’s part of what got me \npractising like mad. \n \nSo here I was in Cambridge, and all of a sudden there were all these other musicians, some \nof them amazingly talented.  I mean, one of them was Andrew Davis, who’s now a well \nknown conductor.  Another is David Atherton, who is also a well known conductor, though \nnot quite so well known, ’cause I think he’s made his career more recently in places like \nHong Kong.  I’ve lost track of David.  And Antony Pay, the clarinettist and conductor – he was \n[and is] an absolutely wonderful musician and... he’s a good friend of mine now – he’s one of \nmy dearest friends – because we talk a lot about how music works and all of that.  He \nworks... he’s a world-class clarinettist, and musical thinker, actually.  He’s got a marvellous \narticle on how to think about playing Mozart, which was an epiphany to me.  [Phrasing in \nContention, in Early Music 24(2), 290 (1996).  Link on my website.] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 69 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n69 \nBut anyway, they were all there as young things, playing in various groups, and David \nAtherton was one of the… he was really the prime mover.  He was the great organiser, and \nhe got groups together to do this and that, and one of them [the works performed] was even \nPierrot Lunaire, which is quite a challenging... it’s a Schoenberg piece, which is really quite \ndemanding technically and musically and everything.  And Atherton had ambitions to \nbecome, you know, really into being able to perform twentieth century music.  And, you \nknow, this was the path that led him on to founding the London Sinfonietta, which is world \nfamous for its performances of contemporary music.  And Atherton was really the founder \nconductor of that.  And quite a number of the musicians – the founder musicians – were this \ncrowd I was in.  So you can imagine, it was thrilling for me to get involved in that.  I was the, \nyou know, leading violinist in that crowd for quite a while.  And I played in Pierrot Lunaire.  I \nhad to learn to play viola, because the violinist also has to double viola.  So I learnt to read \nviola clef, which is an impediment to some violinists.  It was actually easier than I thought it \nwould be. \n \n[0:55:53] \n \nBut that of course used a lot of my time and energy, so of course I got behind with my PhD \nwork.  You know, I was chipping away at some of these instability problems, and so forth.  \nAnd I actually worked on another problem that was related to this annulus experiment I \ndescribed, because working out the flow round and round the annulus before it goes \nunstable, that’s also a nontrivial problem.  You see, you’ve got hot air rising on one wall and \ncold air going down another [water, I should have said], and you’ve got layers on the bottom \nand top which feel the rotation strongly.  The whole thing’s on a rotating table, of course, \n’cause you’re trying to imitate the Earth’s atmosphere. \n \nAnd I was working on those problems but really getting... and I worked on another instability \nproblem, which was a more interesting one than the first one I described to you.  And I got \nquite excited by that, but it was all getting behind.  So to cut a long story short, I took an \nextra year to do my PhD, after making a break with the musical crowd at something like the \nend of my third year.  So the fourth year was just an absolutely focused and concentrated \nMichael McIntyre Page 70 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n70 \neffort to finish my thesis, so... staying up all night in the computer lab... by that time they \nhad a transistor computer, I think. \n \n[0:57:19] \n \nTo what extent were you – had you thought about music as being something that... you say \nthat you broke with it in order to focus on your PhD, but... \n \nYes.  Well, I thought I should finish my PhD, it seemed crazy not to finish it.  And I was still \nthinking, really, about a career in science.  I think I already knew that... okay, what have I \ngot?  I’m gifted in modest ways.  I have a modest gift for mathematics, I have a modest gift \nfor music; neither of them are absolutely tops by world class, but both of them are enough \nto do something significant.  And, well, in the music... well, I had the handicap of only \nstarting the violin at ten; you know, that’s far too late if you’re going to be a world-class \nsoloist or anything like that.  Nevertheless I did get somewhere in the BBC violin \ncompetition.  I thought I’d, you know, have a go to see how far I could get, and I got invited \nto play in one or two London things – but it wasn’t quite enough.  We did have a chamber \ngroup – we did run a chamber group that played piano trios, because I married this \nwonderful pianist.  This was... now we’re jumping forward to my postdoctoral years.  Well, I \nmet her [and we got together] in Cambridge when I was finishing my PhD, and... \n \nCould you tell that story of meeting your future wife? \n \nWell, it was through music.  Actually, I met her quite a while before that, when I was still \nfinishing my school days [no, undergraduate days] in New Zealand, ’cause I would go over to \nAustralia for holidays.  The whole family was in Australia by then, ’cause my father had \nmoved to a job at Monash University in Melbourne, so – I think that was during my \nundergraduate years.  [Yes, early 1962.]  So that was another reason why I finished them in \nthis residential student college, Knox College. \nMichael McIntyre Page 71 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n71 \n \nAll the family was over in Australia; so I would tend to go over there for part of the summer \nholidays.  And one summer I was visiting my parents in Melbourne, and they took it into \ntheir heads, well, we ought to get him playing with some local musicians.  And I did meet \nquite a number of local musicians and have a wonderful time making chamber music with \nsome of them.  And one of them was my future wife.  Her name was Ruth.  Her maiden \nname was Hecht.  She played piano professionally under the name Hecht, using the maiden \nname in the usual way.  Anyway, it somehow was arranged that I would go and play some \nsonatas – violin and piano sonatas – with her.  And I did, and we got on quite well and, you \nknow, I think respected each other as musicians.  Well, I certainly respected her.  And I \nremember arriving at her place and hearing this wonderful sound of... a piece by Ravel that I \nhadn’t heard.  It’s called Le Tombeau de Couperin, which is a brilliant but very elegant piano \npiece.  And there she was playing it with extreme brilliance and elegance, and a wonderful \nlightness and clarity of touch; and I remember this [vividly!].  She was a very talented pianist \nand musical artist. \n \nAnyway, so we had this nice time playing, but that was all it came to at the time.  It was just \none of the, sort of, musical episodes then.  But then she came to England and came to see \nme while I was a research student here – about halfway through that time, I think.  And she \nwas in a bit of a state because her marriage had just broken up.  So there was she with her \nthree children – did I say I had two stepchildren?  I have three stepchildren.  That was a \nmistake: there are three of them [laughs].  But they were her children [and very much mine \ntoo, now].  And so she... I think she came to, sort of, talk it over with me, because she didn’t \nknow anybody much else in... well, she had some friends in London.  They were [living] in \nLondon.  But I suppose she took it into her head, maybe she’d come and look me up and tell \nme.  I took her punting, I think, and she kind of decided to tell me all about it.  And that was \nall, for a while. \n \nBut then... she may have planned [or vaguely hoped, who knows] to sort of suck me in from \nthen on – for all I know – but what happened was she got a teaching job in Cambridge, a sort \nof part-time teaching job.  So she’d come and stay in Cambridge for, oh, I don’t know, one or \nMichael McIntyre Page 72 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n72 \ntwo nights a week, I’ve forgotten exactly.  We put her up in the spare bedroom in the attic of \nour student digs [which funnily enough was in Chaucer Road, as distinct from Latham Road].  And \nthat was all for a while.  But then she decided that she was going to move here, so she \nactually bought a house here, and brought herself and the kids here permanently.  And then \nshe offered me a digs room, more or less rent free [laughs].  I think there was a modest rent, \nbut I was in this fourth year, and I was living on savings, you see, so she was trying to be \nhelpful to me to finish my PhD.  And we became lovers and we got married fairly soon after \nthat.  Well, no, it [getting married] was a year after that, because what then happened was I \nwent to MIT to be a postdoc, and... they came over... or she came over to visit me the first \nChristmas of that, and then they [all four] came over to spend my second postdoc year with \nme. \n \nSo we found this house in, you know, a place called Brookline, just across the river from \nCambridge, Massachusetts.  We got it through a house swap – a rather complicated \narrangement, but anyway the house in Cambridge [UK] was occupied by some American \nsabbatical visitors, and we occupied... it wasn’t actually their house; it was the house of \nanother... it was a sort of triangular swap.  But, erm, never mind that.  The lawyers involved \nthrew up their hands and said, “We can’t handle this,” so we just did it on trust, would you \nbelieve it?  It worked out fine.  We even had a loan of their old station wagon, and we drove \nall the way across the US and back in that, the whole family, camping along the way.  It was a \nwonderful time. \n \nSo there you are, that’s how I acquired my three stepchildren, and they were fairly small at \nthat time.  We learnt all sorts of wonderful things like, you know, how to make and break \ncamp without war breaking out [laughs] and so on.  We did two big trips actually.  We went \nfrom Boston to Florida and back, one winter.  I thought we’d go down in winter and take in a \nbit of sunshine in the Miami district [having been invited to give a talk at the University of Miami].  \nAnd we had these plans to camp... we had some friends in Washington DC, who were \nactually colleagues of my father.  We knew them from Dunedin, New Zealand.  They were \nneighbours then, at Shiel Hill.  And they’d moved to Washington DC, and we stayed with \nthem.  So we got a bed for the night then.  By the way, it was quite a severe winter.  There \nwas a huge snowfall, and we nearly didn’t get away at all.  But we just managed it by a hair. \nMichael McIntyre Page 73 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n73 \n     \nSo there we were staying in Washington, and the next [step in the] plan was to get as far as \nSouth Carolina and start camping.  But when we got to South Carolina, we decided it was \nmuch too cold to camp, and we just decided to carry on through the night.  And then we \nmade this wonderful discovery that, with the whole family in the car [the old station wagon – it \nwas a Chevy 2] – and two drivers – you can carry on through the night, with the other driver \nsleeping in the back.  And one of the kids had the job of staying up to help with the \nnavigation, which they loved.  So we discovered that, and got to Miami, and at last it was \nwarm enough to camp [laughs].  So when we went to California and back in the summer, we \nused the same technique, so we could get past all the boring bits like Kansas without \nstopping [laughs].   \n \n[1:05:44] \n \nCan you say something about your relations with these children, ’cause you’ve suddenly got \nstepchildren, having been a sort of fairly independent research student.  And yes, by that I \nmean describe the sorts of things that you did with them and how you related to them and so \non. \n \nWell, I suppose it was part of my sort of retarded education in emotional intelligence.  I was \nstill going to the Quaker meeting when I was in Cambridge [UK], although again I still found \nthat the meeting itself didn’t do a huge amount for me, as I said before.  But I ended up \ntaking the children in the sort of Sunday School class, and in a funny way I enjoyed that.  \nThere were two or three kids who needed to be looked after and entertained during the \nmeeting, and I volunteered to, you know, do some of that work.  So we, oh, I don’t know, \ndid... Bible stories, and we even built a cardboard model of Solomon’s Temple at one stage. \n \nSo, in a... but I suppose the real interest for me... I was never really interested in the Bible \nstories, except as some sort of cultural background that perhaps one should know \nMichael McIntyre Page 74 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n74 \nsomething about, but more in the psychology of dealing with kids, which was sort of... I was \ngetting to be old enough that it was beginning to be a little interesting, you know.  Little kids \nthese were, eight or nine year olds.  So there I was, working with them.  So I had some sense \nof, you know, to some extent enjoying working with kids. \n \nNow when I went to see... when she [Ruth] saw me in Cambridge, she didn’t have the kids \n[with her], but then naturally I went down to visit them [in London], and I found I... I sort of \nsuddenly got on with them, in a peculiar way.  I remember a scene where I arrived there and \nthe youngest one was squirting his mother [with a water pistol] – ’cause they were in a state \nof upset ’cause the marriage had just broken up, so they were all mixed up.  And there he \nwas squirting his mother, and I completely instinctively sort of stopped him, you see: “You \ndon’t squirt your mother like that.”  I think I even smacked him, you know.  What a thing to \nadmit these days.  But it was all completely instinctive.  But it seemed to be the right thing to \ndo, because things calmed down and the upshot was that the kids began to, you know, \nrespect me as some sort of stabilising figure, I think, and it sort of grew from there...  I have \nto say, I now feel very privileged because they’ve all turned out marvellously.  They’re all \nmanaging their lives very well.  They’re wonderful people in their own ways, and we see all \nof them quite a lot.  [Including two grandchildren now.  Ruth and I count our blessings almost every \nday.] \n \nCould you say more about your interest at that point in the sort of psychology, as you put it, \nof dealing with young children? \n \nWell, it was all rather instinctive.  I’ve, er... I’m not very able at emotional-intelligent things \nbut I’m not completely stupid either, I suppose.  And with this kind of – well, call...  you feel \nthat there’s a need, so you respond to it, I think.  And there was a need to stabilise this \nfamily situation so, I don’t know, I seemed to be having some success with it and Ruth was, I \nthink, grateful at the time, and we sort of grew closer as a result, I think.  And I felt I, you \nknow, was becoming part of the family.  So that was – you know – I suppose for someone \nwho’s rather distant from their own family... remember, all my folks were in Australia.   I \nMichael McIntyre Page 75 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n75 \nsuppose...  I’m only theorising, because what really happened was, some sort of instinct took \nme there, that’s all.   \n \nDid you at this point have an interest in, as I know you now have, in how the children were \ngrowing themselves, how they were... ? \n \nOh, I think I was, yes.  I mean, I did the sort of thing with them that my father had done with \nme.  I helped them make the model boats and planes and stuff like that, and tried to, you \nknow, play games.  We had a Meccano set, which...  Made things with motors and so on, and \nfooled around with that.  One of the kids actually [laughs], like most...  One of the kids... it’s \nfunny how they have different characters... the youngest one liked making things.  He was \nthe one that I actually made... model this-and-that, mostly. \n \nThe other one, the boy next up, he was more of a... how would I describe... I think he was a \nbit more disturbed by the breakup of the marriage.  He was closer to his father, a bit less \nflexible.  [And more angry, I could have added.]  And the main thing he did with the Meccano \nset was set the motor spinning... it was the same [electric] motor that I made the turntable \nwith, with my father – just the same kit – amazing how that thing survived [laughs].  But of \ncourse if you put something on to the main shaft it would spin like mad, like the propeller of \nan aeroplane.  (Well, of course, one of the games I used to play was pretending it was the \npropeller of an aeroplane, obviously.)  But anyway, he would set it up with it spinning \nhorizontally, and he’d drop nuts and bolts on it to see them go ping, ping to the corners of \nthe room.  And I suppose that was his way of being [an] experimenter, exploring the world, \nyou know.  It was quite fun actually [laughs]. \n \n[I could have added something about my oldest stepchild, a girl, though in those early years most of \nher play was with her mother – my grasp of ‘girlie’ things being pretty limited then.  She was \nwonderfully accepting of me as a stepfather, though, and grew up to be a kind, generous, and no-\nnonsense adult, a stalwart family member.] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 76 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n76 \n[1:11:36] \n \nCould you take me through the decision to do the postdoc at MIT?  What I’m saying is, why \ndo that rather than anything else? \n \nWell, by that time I had got through the PhD, more or less, and felt I’d become qualified in, \nyou know, these fluid... geophysical fluid dynamical problems, so called.  Atmosphere–ocean \ndynamics is a better description.  And so one naturally thought, where would one go next?  \nAnd again my supervisor, Francis Bretherton, was... he thought... he suggested, I think, well, \na jolly good place to go would be MIT because... look, in some ways that’s... I don’t know \nwhether you’d say the centre of the universe.  It has a very strong tradition in that area, and \nthat’s where the aforementioned Jule Charney was a professor.  And a colleague of his called \nNorman Phillips was another very famous early pioneer, in numerical weather forecasting \nespecially – did some of the very earliest computer models of the atmosphere.  So there \nwere two luminaries there and I think Francis just thought, well, that’s where you should go \nif you want to get further in this area.  So he wrote – he must have written, you know, a \nstrong recommendation for me – because the next thing I knew was they said, oh, we’ll have \nhim, you know, the salary will be this and that, and so on, for one year with a possible \nextension to two, I think it said.  So I went.  I went by myself at first, and Ruth and the kids \nfollowed a year later, as I said. \n \n[1:13:23] \n \nAnd what was the – could you describe what you encountered when you arrived?  In other \nwords, describe the Department physically, but also its people. \n \nWell, it was already in a sort of tall building – must have been about a twenty storey \nbuilding.  You know the MIT campus, it’s towards the back and it’s called the Green Building.  \n‘Green’ after some millionaires called Cecil and Ida Green, who gave the money, I suppose.  \nMichael McIntyre Page 77 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n77 \nAnd, you know, it had some Earth science, geology, and so on, on the bottom half, I think, \nand the Meteorology Department was more or less the top half, and I was toward the \nbottom of the top half.  I think they already had a bit of oceanography.  Let’s see... there’s a \nvery famous theoretical oceanographer called Carl Wunsch, and he was around.  I don’t... \nwas he already an assistant professor?  I’m not sure.  He might have been at [the] Woods \nHole [Oceanographic Institution].  There were all these connections.  It had been long \nappreciated that fluid dynamics in the atmosphere and ocean was fundamentally similar in \nmany ways.  They’re both flows of nearly frictionless fluid, with important Coriolis effects – \nthat’s effects of the Earth’s rotation – and also important buoyancy effects...  So it’s typical \nto have light fluid lying over heavy.  I mean, when you look out of an aeroplane window you \ncan see all these stratified clouds.  It’s kind of obvious.  And the ocean does [something \nsimilar]... it’s almost inevitable, because there’s nothing to stop it being stratified.  Once \nyou’ve got heavy fluid, it tends to go to the bottom.  That’s very fundamental.  [I omitted to \nsay that before going to MIT I participated in a summer programme at the Woods Hole \nOceanographic Institution, attending lectures and doing a small research project – this was the \nsummer of 1967 .] \n \nAnd MIT had been a place where one of the great pioneers of the previous generation, a \nman called [Carl-Gustaf] Rossby – he’s got his name on practically everything in the subject \n[laughs].  There’s a Rossby number, and a Rossby deformation length and a Rossby \nadjustment problem, and a Rossby everything.  But he was a great pioneer.  And he was the \nHead of [the Meteorology] Department at MIT before the war.  And part of the way he was \nable to advance the subject was by selling it as important to the economy, and to the \nmilitary and everything, you know.  We needed to understand the weather and climate \nbetter, obviously, and Rossby was a very eloquent advocate, and he got these [Meteorology] \nDepartments set up and funded.  And he was a brilliant thinker himself.  So there you are. \n \nSo that was the tradition, where they came from.  I don’t think they had the Green Building \nin those days.  But the next generation included Jule Charney and Norman Phillips; they \nwere the, kind of, leaders, at the time I was there.  And for me it was, you know, paradise, \nbecause they were old-fashioned scientists who believed in giving their young people their \nMichael McIntyre Page 78 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n78 \nhead, and a lot of intellectual freedom.  So I was basically free to work on anything I fancied.  \nDifficult to imagine that, these days. \n \nSo I worked on some things I fancied, and did one or two interesting problems [laughs], and \nhad a great time, you know, finding out what it’s like to live in America... and go to all these \nseminars at Woods Hole... they had a rotating seminar where – they had all sorts of \ninteresting talks from oceanographers and atmospheric dynamicists.  It rotated between \nMIT, Woods Hole, Rhode Island, [and] Yale... [and Harvard] – I think that was about it – and, \nyou know, you’d have a talk for two hours.  It was, sort of, more the Chinese style of talk \nwhere you go on for two hours, with maybe a short break in the middle, and completely free \nto interrupt all the time, so there was very often a lively discussion from all sorts of very \ninterested people – some of them, you know, great luminaries in the subject.  So it was \nwonderful for me to pick up all these cultural currents and get a broader view of what was \ngoing on in the field. \n \n[1:17:33] \n \nAnd what did you study in particular?  You said you looked at a couple of... ? \n \nOkay.  Well, it gets a little technical now.  I spent quite a lot of time on a problem, er... if you \nthink about... I think I’m going to have to talk about an idealised thought-experiment.  Some \nof these phenomena do occur in the real ocean actually.  But let’s think about this annulus \nthing, and flow round and round.  And you’ve got gradients of temperature and/or salinity, \nthings that make the fluid more or less buoyant...  ’s  what make it stratified.  I mean, these \n[this] annulus does the same thing; it stratifies the flow.  You’ve got heavy fluid beneath, and \nlighter above, and there’s a gradient.  Now if you imagine a shear flow in that, with some \nparts of it going faster than others, then there are other sorts of instabilities that are not the \nsort I was talking about before, where it gets wavy – but there are other sorts where it \nsimply overturns in a symmetric way without going wavy.  And some people at... well, \nsome... in particular, a man at Princeton had been doing computer experiments on that sort \nMichael McIntyre Page 79 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n79 \nof flow, and there were some peculiar phenomena that weren’t understood at the time, in \nwhich the overturning took place, but it sort of broke up into a number of cells.  This is \ngetting rather esoteric, you see. \n \nI’m following it and I’ll say if I don’t. \n \nBut it turned out that in some of those flows..  okay, okay, let me just backtrack a moment.  \nInstabilities of that general sort of had been studied for quite some time, but the flow in cells \nin this computer experiment took place under conditions that would have been predicted to \nbe stable by the classical theories.  And it turned out that, to get the instability, what you \nhad to have was what we call a double-diffusive effect. \n \nNow I’d better stop and explain that.  I’ve told you that buoyancy forces are important.  If \nthe fluid moves around, it notices whether it’s heavier than its surroundings; [then] it wants \nto sink again.  That’s part of the dynamics of this sort of overturning.  But also it’s going \nround – each piece of fluid is going round like a flywheel – and if you think about that you \nrealise that if it’s going awfully fast it wants to fly outwards.  So there’s a sort of inwards–\noutwards thing that’s a bit like the buoyancy force, but not quite.  And the upshot is that the \nway those two things interplay depends on how quickly you wipe out an anomaly. \n \nNow okay, think of a ring of fluid going much faster than its surroundings.  Well, it won’t do \nthat forever because it’ll feel the viscous force and try to slow down.  It’ll try to come to the \nspeed of its surroundings, if you give it time.  Similarly, the buoyancy... if it’s heavier and \nwants to sink down, that heaviness, that buoyancy anomaly will, if nothing else happens... \nwill tend to diffuse away, because of its [negative] heat; if it’s cold and wants to sink, it’ll... \nheat will diffuse in from either side [and/or from above and below], from the warmer \nsurrounding fluid, okay.  It’s [colder, or it could also be] warmer, than its surroundings, so you \nhave to have that sort of contrast.  [A garbled attempt to say simply that diffusion reduces the \nbuoyancy anomaly, regardless of whether it’s a cold anomaly or a warm anomaly, relative to the \nsurroundings.] \nMichael McIntyre Page 80 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n80 \n \nNow it turns out that the instability that this Princeton chap had in his apparatus [in his \ncomputer experiment, I meant] depended on the flywheel motion diffusing faster than the \nbuoyancy motion [than the buoyancy anomaly, I meant].  That’s why we call it a double-\ndiffusive instability, because it depends on two diffusivities being different.  And so roughly \nspeaking, what happens is that – if you imagine an overturning, you get the flywheel motion \nbecause, the moment fluid moves in or out, it wants to spin up or down.  It’s the ballerina \neffect.  But then if you kill that spin quickly by the surrounding viscosity, then you actually \nreduce the sideways force effect, but keep the buoyancy part, so it’s able to go unstable \nmore easily, okay?  And it turned out that’s what was causing these cellular motions. \n \nSo I did a lot of rather technical, you know, complicated calculations, to study that sort of \ninstability.  And I went down to Princeton and got this chap to give me some output from his \ncomputer, so I could see whether that matched what he was getting.  And it turned out that \nit did, so we felt we’d actually understood this kind of thing.  And, in a way, that’s a good \nexample, you see, of curiosity-driven research.  There was no obvious application, or \npractical consequence in sight.  We simply wanted to understand what on earth was going \non in this computer.  Which is how all science worthy of the name works, you know.  You’re \nconfronted with something strange, and you want to understand what’s going on. \n \nBut just to finish the story, it turned out years later that people had observed things that \nwere essentially this phenomenon in the real ocean – especially, if I recall correctly... let \nme... I’m going to get this wrong, you know.  I’m going to stop talking about that ’cause I’m \nnot sure I remember the details.  What I can tell you though is that it was done in laboratory \nexperiments, and people got quite excited about that.  They set up an experiment where you \nhad a rotating fluid and you made some parts rotate faster than others by having a disc.  You \nknow, you had a container rotating at one rate, and a disc that’s rotating, faster I think, and \nyou had buoyancy from salt stratification.  And that’s a good candidate for this sort of \ninstability, because the salt diffuses much more slowly than the velocity.  And sure enough, \nyou got layers.  You got overturning cells, like the theory leads you expect.  So that was kind \nof nice. \nMichael McIntyre Page 81 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n81 \n \nBut I suppose what I could fairly say is that it’s just one  of a class of double-diffusive \ninstabilities, some of which are certainly important in the real ocean, and in stars too by the \nway.  That’s a recent development.  I can’t claim the credit for this, but I’ve been, you know, \na bit involved in some research on the Sun’s interior and its differential rotation.  And as a \nresult I’ve got to learn about some things that astrophysicists are doing.  And one of the \nthings they’ve done is shown that double-diffusive instabilities might be quite important for \nunderstanding the evolution of stars and planetary systems, which is a hot topic these days.  \nSo it’s another example of... well, you know, you can’t predict what..  You could never write \na research proposal for doing any of this, as I said in my BlueSci essay.  [2006, link on my home \npage.]  If I had a crystal ball and could see in advance what the final outcome of research I’d \ndone would be, I still couldn’t write a successful proposal because, if I said I’m going to do \nthis research and it will impact on this sort of thing, and that – on stellar dynamics and so on \nand so forth, and understanding the ozone hole, which is perhaps a more important thing I \ndid since then – nobody would believe it, because you’re seeing far too far ahead for \nanybody to see it coming.  So you just can’t do that. \n \nYou can’t ever... you can’t... when you’re proposing for scientific funds...  My policy has \nalways been: always be honest.  I never propose to do something I don’t think I can do.  But \nyou’ve got to tailor it to the current culture.  It’s got to get past some committee, and you’ve \ngot to make it intelligible to them, and make it seem plausible.  And it almost... and you \nknow that what you propose won’t be the real outcome, because if it has a real outcome \nthat’s important, it will be because something unexpected has happened. \n \n[1:26:33] \n \nThank you.  I know that, as you say, this was work that was... as you’ve just gone through, \nthis was work that was being done without a clear application, but how did it relate to the \nexistence of numerical weather forecasting within the Department, the fact that this problem \nMichael McIntyre Page 82 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n82 \nwas... you know, you were available to... it was possible to investigate this because of what \nwas going on in terms of numerical weather prediction.  Did it bear any relation to it? \n \nWell, we all knew that numerical weather prediction involved the sort of fluid dynamics that \nwe are studying, but to do it in a way that’s close enough to the real atmosphere to be – you \nknow, to have practical value – you do need a big computer.  That’s always been the case.  \nThat was...  As I think I said to you before, I actually met the leader at the... when I was still a \nresearch student [or it might have been after I got back from MIT] I met the leading, you know, \nscientist involved in numerical weather prediction at the Met Office; but of course their \nwhole focus was building computer models.  They didn’t have time to study fluid dynamics; \nthey just had to try and code up the equations and hope it would work. \n \nAnd that wasn’t where it was started.  Of course, Jule Charney, my postdoc mentor at MIT, \nwas actually very famous for his pioneering work in numerical weather prediction.  The very \nfirst efforts at that were early in his career in, well, around 1950, if I recall, at Princeton, \nbecause [with] the new computers that were available after the war, they... people saw that \nthey ought to try the numerical weather prediction problem.  I mean, the idea of the \nnumerical weather prediction problem had been around for ages.  It was pioneered by a \nman called Lewis Fry Richardson, who was, you know, active – he was an Englishman – he \nwas active in this research in the early twentieth century.  He wrote a famous book called \nWeather Prediction by Numerical Process [CUP, 1922].  And he had a vision of the future, if \nyou please, in which it was all done by hand!  So he imagined something the size of the \nAlbert Hall filled with human computers number-crunching, and all under the control of a \nsort of conductor-like figure in the centre, who would, you know, try and monitor how the \ncalculation was going.  And if somebody was getting behind over there, shine a red torch on \nthem, and shine a green torch on the ones that were ahead, so they could take a break \n[laughs]. \n \nBut of course they had no idea of electronic computation in those days, so it was only a \ndream.  But of course the scientific point was clear enough.  We think we know the \nequations of fluid dynamics, so in principle we should be able to predict how the \nMichael McIntyre Page 83 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n83 \natmosphere moves.  And so he did quite a lot of the pioneering thinking about that.  He even \ndid a trial calculation – by hand, if you please! – on a coarse grid covering Europe, a very \ncoarse resolution.  It went completely wrong, because of some technical reasons that I could \nexplain, about errors in the initial conditions.  That might be an interesting thing to talk \nabout but I’m not going to do that yet because it would be quite a long digression – the \nproblem of ‘initialisation of weather forecasts’, and so-called ‘balanced motion’. \n \nOkay, so I was saying, Jule Charney, he was the first visionary scientist who had computing \npower at his disposal.  This, by the way, was largely due to John von Neumann, who was the \ngreat maths genius, who very much was a mover and shaker in getting computers out into \napplications other than, you know, wartime decryption, essentially.  So I think it’s usually \nsaid that von Neumann suggested, oh, we should do weather now.  He probably knew about \nRichardson’s work.  And Jule Charney was the young postdoc who came in and helped to \nmake it happen.  And Norman Phillips was another.  So my two postdoc mentors were both \nwell known – great pioneers in their field. \n \nSo when the UK Met Office started to do it, which was in my student time – that would have \nbeen at least ten years on – they were beginning to do it, they were really just catching up \nwith the American project.  People were beginning to see... Of course, to be fair, the \nAmerican project was entirely experimental.  To make it operational, and actually practically \nuseful in day-to-day weather forecasting, that was still a long way off.  I think it’s fair to say \nthe Met Office was about as early with that as anyone else.   \n \n[1:31:23] \n \nWhat did you see of what else was going on then in the Department, including numerical \nweather prediction, while you were there as a postdoc?  You’ve described what you were \nworking on but what... \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 84 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n84 \nHang on, as a postdoc at MIT do you mean, or [at] Cambridge? \n \nYes, at MIT, yes, sorry.   \n \nOkay.  Well, people weren’t specially doing numerical weather – when Jule Charney was \ninvolved in numerical weather prediction, that was in the early ‘50s – well, throughout the \n‘50s I think he was more or less involved.  So okay, when did I go to MIT?  It was ’67, wasn’t \nit?  It was August or September or late in ’67 [after spending the summer at the Woods Hole \nOceanographic Instituition].  And Jule was not working on numerical weather prediction then.  \nHe was working on other problems – a set of other problems.  I think his work on \ndesertification came from that time, for example.  I mean, he had very broad interests.  He \nworked on a variety of things.  He was also interested in this ‘balance problem’ that I \nmentioned, this balance and initialisation, although I don’t think he’d actually worked on it \nspecially himself [at that time, I meant – he had worked on it in the ’50s].  But we had interesting \nconversations. \n \nI think it was Jule who first mentioned to me – look, the balance problem, it’s related to the \nLighthill theory of aerodynamic sound generation – which was a penetrating remark. This \nagain gets rather technical.  Will you remind me... when I... let’s not get off on that now, \n’cause it’s too long a digression, but when/if we talk about balance and initialisation  just \nremind me about Lighthill, because there’s a long and convoluted technical story with that, \nthat’s lasted until recent years actually.  Jule died quite a few years ago.  He got cancer, poor \nman, but he would have been very interested in these latest developments in that field. \n \nErm... I’m trying to think what else.  You see, he and Norman Phillips were both very happy \nto leave me free to do my own thing, so they didn’t try and get me doing what they were \ndoing, or anything.  So the downside of that is I was probably not completely aware of \neverything they were doing.  I just had to look up their list of publications and find out \n[laughs]. \nMichael McIntyre Page 85 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n85 \n \n[1:33:59] \n \nWhat was then the second problem that you worked on in your postdoc?  You’ve described \nthe first, involving the double diffusion and the development of the... \n \nOkay.  That was quite a... that occupied quite a lot of my first postdoctoral year.  Gosh, \nhmm... I’m slightly stuck.  Perhaps that’s my memory failing me.  Surely I did at least one \nother thing then.  I was... oh well, of course, I did spend quite a bit of time writing up stuff \nfor my thesis.  Yeah, I think that might have been a substantial call on my time, because I \nnever got any of it published before taking the oral [the PhD viva].  But I did have some \nresults.  Yes, I remember now, I wrote some of that up as a paper for publication, and also as \na fellowship paper for St John’s College.  I was too late –  having taken four years over my \nPhD – that excluded me from the Trinity fellowship competition [laughs], which is pretty \ntough anyway.  So who knows, I might never have made it there.  But I did get in time for the \nSt John’s research fellowship [competition] and I did win a St John’s research fellowship.  And \nthat was for, I think, a pair of papers that came out of my thesis.  So that plus the double-\ndiffusive problem... it might be why I don’t remember doing anything much... \n \nOh, wait a minute, I remember one other thing I did, which never got published.  I think I did \nit at that time, or I began work on it at that time, so that must have taken a lot of time.  You \nknow, if the bureaucrats were on to me I’d be in trouble, because I’d spent this time on \nsomething that didn’t get published [laughs] – although I learnt quite a lot of useful stuff.  \nThere’s a phenomenon in the ocean in which you get...  It’s called the equatorial \nundercurrent.  It’s especially conspicuous in the Pacific.  And what seems to happen is that \nthe trade winds blow from east to west across the Pacific tropics, and so there’s a tendency \nto push the water westward.  But there has to be a return flow somewhere.  And some of \nthat’s round the sides, but some of that return flow seems to take place along the equator \nunderneath the surface flow.  And it’s quite a striking phenomenon that’s quite narrow.  It \nreally is on the equator. \nMichael McIntyre Page 86 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n86 \n \nSo that’s interesting, you see, especially to a fluid dynamicist: how does it know to go along \nthe equator, for heaven’s sake?  There’s all sorts of topography and irregularities and islands \nhere and there, why wouldn’t it wander around like most other ocean and atmosphere \ncurrents?  And so there’s a lot of interest in this, and people went out and measured it.  So it \nhas this narrow jet profile, and it sticks along the equator, and so there has to be something \nabout the Earth’s rotation.  That’s the only way this thing can know about the equator... is \n[to] feel the particular pattern of Coriolis forces and – okay, it’s also to do with the \nstratification. \n \nRemember these flows are heavily stratified: they like to sit in layers with heavy fluid below \nand light above.  So what happens, if you remember about Coriolis forces, the main effect... \nif you’ve got this heavy stratification, the main effect is on horizontal motion, okay?  The \nstratification tends to keep the motion more or less horizontal.  So the only effect of the \nrotation is the effect associated with horizontal velocity components, and that means that \nnorth of the equator, if I push a piece of atmosphere or ocean in one direction, it wants to \nturn to the right, and if I do it on the other side of the equator, it wants to turn to the left.  \nSo there’s a change in sign of the Coriolis effect, and everybody thought, ah, that must be \nwhy the current is there, because it’s noticing the Coriolis effect changing sign.  I mean, it’s \nstill difficult to give any other simple explanation. \n \nSo people were trying to make more detailed theories, and I had a go at one version of this.  \nI think that’s what occupied me for quite a while.  I did a thought-experiment in which I said, \nokay, if I push the water at one end of the Pacific, will it – will the pushed water just spread \nout like it would in an ordinary room – if I do that it just spreads out – or will it want to go \nalong the equator?  And I managed to get some results in... for a simplified problem in which \nI did a gentle push.  This is another example of simplifying the equations by making some \nparameters small... er... this is the strength of the push.  So if I start pushing the water \n[gently] – I discovered that the motion is a bit like what happens if you push water in a ditch, \nokay?  Think of a... or a gutter at the edge of a roof.  Think of some long channel with water \nin it, and a piston at one end.  If I start the piston moving it’s pretty obvious that the water \nMichael McIntyre Page 87 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n87 \nlevel will rise just ahead of it.  But then the elevated water has to go over to undisturbed \nwater at some stage [some distance away]; and the place where that happens propagates as a \nwave [getting further and further away].  So if I start pushing here, and if the wave speed is fast \nenough, the deep water will... the region of deep water will extend continuously, [further and \nfurther away] from where I’m pushing.  And furthermore, everywhere underneath the \nelevated surface, the water will be moving with the piston, so all this water will move. \n \nAnd I concluded that’s a bit like what happens under the equator, but instead of [channel] \nwalls you have the Coriolis parameter changing sign, and so you still get the same sort of \neffect.  I would still argue that’s one simple way of beginning to understand the equatorial \nundercurrent.  But since I worked on the problem, and failed to publish anything on it, I’ve \nlost track a little bit of what the latest, you know, judgements are on that. \n \nSo the Coriolis effect makes the equatorial bit a bit like a channel, the Coriolis changing sign \nallows it to be analogous with pushing something down a pipe?   \n \nYes.  Actually, the simplest version of the problem is if you start pushing from the west edge \nof the Pacific.  I got that the wrong way round, I think.  You get similar things either way, but \nwith the west it’s simpler and you can begin to see that intuitively, because if a piece of \nwater wants to go southward, it tends to get turned back, you see, so that’s the sort of... \nthat’s not a complete explanation, but it’s a sort of beginning of an understanding, I would \nsay. \n \n[I could have added that there was yet another problem that I worked on  at that time – indeed I \ncracked it and then talked about it for a bit – but never published the results because I heard on the \ngrapevine that someone else, a Swedish oceanographer called Gösta Walin, who later became a good \nfriend, had cracked it first.  So I initiated a correspondence in which I pushed him to publish instead!  \nThis is what’s called the ‘stratified spinup’ problem – a problem involving the interplay of Coriolis, \nbuoyancy and viscous forces – regarding which there had been an unresolved issue while I was at \nMIT,in fact two claimed solutions both of which turned out to be wrong!] \nMichael McIntyre Page 88 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n88 \n \n[1:41:31] \n \nWhat decisions were you making at this point about what you were going to do next or what \nyou might do next, or what your options were or what it would be interesting or valuable to \nwork on? \n \nWell, again I just fell into it.  I’m a classic case of things happening to me, rather than the \nreverse, in every respect.  So I had this two years of funding at MIT, and then there was an \nopening at Cambridge.  It’s much tougher for the young things these days; there aren’t so \nmany openings.  There are more talented young scientists competing for permanent \npositions.  Well, this wasn’t quite a permanent position, but it was a sort of, I don’t know, \nsemi-permanent perhaps.  It was called ‘Assistant Director of Research’. \n \nI think one reason I got it was that I’d won the research fellowship at St John’s, so there were \nsome, you know, referees who thought I was promising, at least, and maybe had \naccomplished a bit, so they decided to take me on for this position.  And it involved a bit of \nteaching, but not as much as a full lectureship.  And I think the money [unintelligible] probably \narose from George Batchelor’s efforts to expand the Department into this geophysical area, \nbut I don’t really know.  But anyway, that was there, and I got the position.  And then a \nlectureship came up, and I got that too. \n \nYou know, I was so naïve at that age.  I – I didn’t immediately jump at the lectureship.  I said \nto George, “I’d rather spend more time on research, and less on teaching.”  And George said, \n“Don’t be silly, a lecturer is a more secure position.”  So I took it [laughs] and the rest is \nhistory.  That was a tenure-track position, so I had essentially a permanent career at \nCambridge.  And this Department has always been a stimulating place, and it’s a source of \ngood students, so there never was any reason to move – even when in later years I was \noffered what looked like tempting Directorships and things.  But I never – I always – I looked \nMichael McIntyre Page 89 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n89 \nat some of them, but I always ended up saying, I don’t have that sort of talent, I can’t handle \nthe politics, and the bureaucracy, and the fundraising.  I’m not good at that stuff, so I don’t \nwant to be a Director even if it sounds rather grand [laughs]. \n \nSo in what year was the Assistant Director of Research post? \n \nYes, so called... I mean, and you’d... it’s really a research assistantship.  It started in October \n1969, so that was after the two postdoc years at MIT, straight in.  So how  lucky was I, you \nknow?  I’ve been lucky all my life, Paul [laughs]. \n \nDo you remember the interview for that post as Assistant Director? \n \nI don’t think they even bothered with an interview.  They must have consulted some \nreferees.  I’m sure Francis Bretherton was one of them.  Francis was still here in the \nDepartment.  I expect he had a say on the relevant committee.  And they probably asked for \nreferee letters from Jule Charney and Norman Phillips, I should think, but I don’t know.  I \nmean, what else could they have done?  So Charney and Phillips must have said, well, he’s \ndone some quite interesting stuff.  I don’t know, they must have thought this [laughs] \ndouble-diffusive thing was, you know, sort of interesting in its peculiar way.  [And I might have \ngot some credit for the unpublished work too, which probably got some local attention.] \n \n[1:45:07] \n \nI didn’t tell you the other thing I did for my thesis, which I then worked up and worked a bit \nmore on for publication, and which won me the [St John’s] fellowship.  And that was another \nwavy instability problem that was technically quite difficult at the time, and of... a lot greater \ninterest.  Now how can I explain this?  It’s worth having a shot, because it connects with \nthings I did later, and am still interested in.  If we go back to this thought-experiment where \nMichael McIntyre Page 90 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n90 \nwe start with flow around latitude circles, and we let it go unstable in this wavy mode, which \ndoesn’t, by the way, depend on diffusivity at all.  It’s a completely different phenomenon – \nthe sort of instability that makes cyclone and anticyclones. \n \nNow there are different versions of this problem that are technically harder or easier, and \none of the harder ones is one in which the flow you start with has a jet-like structure.  So \nthere’s some middle latitude where it’s strongest, okay, and the strength dies off to either \nside.  And by the way, these flows we’re talking about always have differential rotation in \nthe vertical.  So, to get realistic anticyclones and so on, you need the flow to increase with \nheight.  It’s got what we call vertical shear, and that goes for all the problems I’ve been \ntalking about without exception, including the diffusive ones.  So we’ve got vertical shear, \nbut now we’ve also got horizontal shear, because of this horizontal jet-like structure, which \nis a step toward the real thing, which is always jet-like. \n \nNow if you... to solve that problem it gets technically harder mathematically, for reasons \nthat are difficult to explain... But... okay, the...  my first thesis problem, remember, I could \nsolve it by a combination of paper mathematics and [a] rather simple computer program, on \nthis vacuum-tube thing called EDSAC II.  This new problem is... takes... well, again, I tackled it \nby a combination of paper and computer techniques.  And it’s a good illustration of what I \nwas saying about asymptotics, because there’s a case where you can get somewhere just on \npaper, in which you say that the horizontal shear is weak.  So you say it’s only a small \ndeparture from the original problem, which had only vertical shear. \n \nCould you just remind us of the difference between vertical shear and horizontal shear?  \nWhat is the vertical shear? \n \nYes, of course.  You’ve got to imagine the Earth – and vertical means radial, of course, \nupwards, away from the centre of the Earth.  And the vertical shear means that the basic \nvelocity, the velocity I started with in this thought-experiment, round latitude circles... as I \nMichael McIntyre Page 91 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n91 \ngo up, it’s increasing.  If I imagine flying in a balloon and going up, I would be in stronger and \nstronger wind. \n \nOkay, yep. \n \nThat’s vertical shear.  And... so... the problem with only vertical shear is simpler because you \nhave to work out the structure only in the vertical dimension, whereas if you’ve got \nhorizontal shear as well, it’s got structure in the horizontal as well; that’s not trivial.  And \nthat’s a much bigger computational task.  And indeed, at the time it wasn’t really clear how \nbest to tackle it.  So I took an intermediate step, which was to say, let’s try and solve it for \nthe... for weak [horizontal] shear. \n \nBy the way, I wasn’t the first to do this.  There was an earlier paper, funnily enough from one \nof Jule Charney’s students.  This might have been part of what got me the fellowship, you \nsee, because this student of Charney’s, who’s actually a very famous senior man now... his \nname is Joseph Pedlosky.  (He just [now] got a big prize at the American Geophysical Union.)  \nBut, yeah, he’s very famous for his work, mostly on ocean currents actually.  But he was \nJule’s student and he did... he was not the first, but the first to do rather systematically \nproblems with both horizontal and vertical shear, of the kind I’m talking about.  That was his \nthesis.  [He made progress by drastically simplifying the vertical structure, while allowing continuous \nhorizontal shear.]  But then he... he, actually, was the first to think of this idea: let’s try and get \nat this [now with continuous vertical structure and] with weak horizontal shear, and do the \nasymptotics for that.  And he got it wrong!  This was a paper he worked out after his thesis, \nso that was one of his postdoc things, I suppose. \n \nAnd he published this paper; it was technically rather formidable looking.  He brings in some \nquantum-mechanical formalism and it looks all very impressive, but actually he got it wrong \n[laughs].  And I realised this.  So that was my chance, you see.  So I did that problem and got \nit right.  Nobody’s questioned it since then, but actually there are a lot of checks, so there’s \nno real doubt that I got it right.  So I had the effect of weak horizontal shear.  But then I took \nMichael McIntyre Page 92 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n92 \nit further, you see, because the technique used for that, the asymptotic technique... you can \nget the first effects of weak vertical shear, but then you can get what’s called the further \ncorrections, and you can keep on going and refining and refining the results, by calculating \nmore and more terms in the mathematical equation [giving the answer as what’s called a ‘series’ \nof terms]. \n \nIt gets more and more complicated.  But you can at least see whether, you know, the thing – \nnow it gets technical here – I was going to say converges, but there’s a technicality about \nwhat you really mean by converging.  Let’s say, there’s an issue about whether you’re going \nto get close to the real answer by taking a certain number of terms, alright [laughs].  And I \nmanaged to show that you could get close in that sense, by taking... I think I ended up \ntaking, oh... perhaps some... I think I... I forget how many terms.  There was quite a number \nthough.  [Eleven, actually – but that was just playing safe; the last few made hardly any difference.]  \nWhat I had to do at that point was to bring in the computer, and use it to help me calculate \nthe more complicated terms, because they got too cumbersome to write out. \n  \nSo this was a sort of intimate combination of paper mathematics and computing, and that \nwas what was keeping me up all night in the computer lab in my last year, trying to get this \ndamn thing to work.  And I wouldn’t... with something so complicated, I would never believe \nthat – ever – unless I had it two independent ways.  And eventually I got it, the same answer \nby two independent routes, and I said, “Eureka, I’ve got it!”  And then I knew I had my thesis \nin the bag, and I went home and caught up with my sleep [laughs]. \n \nHow did you know that you were getting close to the real answer? \n \nThere are consistency tests.  You add a term and you see it doesn’t make much difference.  \nAnd... oh, wait a minute, I’ve just remembered something about that.  I actually did a piece \nof pure mathematics, which I don’t very often, but in this case it was complicated enough I \nfelt I should try and actually prove that this thing converges.  I was talking about \nasymptotics.  You see, there’s a technical thing that... asymptotics in the technical sense is \nMichael McIntyre Page 93 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n93 \nnot the same thing as convergence.  But actually this thing does converge.  That means that \nif you take [an] infinite number of terms – you keep on taking them forever – it gets closer \nand closer to some definite answer.  That’s convergence.  And I proved that that was the \ncase with this series.  I felt I had to go to those lengths, which is a bit unusual in an applied-\nmaths paper, because the great Joe Pedlosky had published a different result, you see \n[laughs].  And I was just a young upstart trying to make my name.  But that’s all on the \nrecord, a rather big paper in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics [laughs].  [J. Fluid Mech. 40, 273–\n306 (1970).] \n \n[1:53:13] \n \nThank you. \n \nI haven’t told you why horizontal shear’s interesting. \n \nOh yes, yes. \n \nBut we can come to that later.  Just remind me to talk about that later.  There’s a deeply \ninteresting reason why we should want to understand the horizontal shear. \n \nWell, I was just going to ask, at the point that you were doing this, in other words in the final \nyear of your PhD, staying up in the computer laboratory, what was the... now, without \nwanting to say that, you know, there has to be a particular kind of applied outcome, what \nwas the context?  Why was this thought to be an important thing or an interesting thing to \nstudy? \n \nTo do this thing with horizontal shear? \nMichael McIntyre Page 94 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n94 \n \nYes. \n \nOh well, that was thing I was going to come to.  The reason is that, if you look at the real \nEarth’s atmosphere with its cyclones and anticyclones and so on, and furthermore if you \nlook at computer models of the same thing in aquaplanets, you always get this result that in \nmy time as a postdoc was considered a huge mystery, which is that the jets in the real \natmosphere tend to sharpen themselves.  And that, you’ve got to realise, is very different \nfrom what an ordinary domestic jet does.  If I blow candles out, I’ve got to have the candles \npretty close, because the ordinary jet I blow from my mouth spreads out quite fast.  If \ndomestic jets behaved like geophysical jets – these are the atmospheric jet streams, the Gulf \nStream, all those great currents in our Earth system – I could blow candles out all the way \nacross the room because the jet hangs together.  It keeps itself together; it keeps sharpening \nitself.  It doesn’t spread out, you see.  And this means there’s got to be some sort of... I like \nto call it anti-frictional  effect.  Some people called it ‘negative viscosity’ at the time I was a \npostdoc.  And it’s on record that it was [then] regarded as a big unsolved mystery. \n \nAnd... now these instability problems with horizontal shear... many of them showed this \nsame tendency for anti-frictional  effects.  Let me try and make that a little clearer.  The \ninstability makes the flow wavy, and the waviness has a certain structure, and it turns out \nthat the structure is such that momentum – you know what momentum is, it’s the motion of \nthe fluid, let’s say, the motion of fluid mass – tends to get more concentrated in the centre \nof the flow.  Because whenever something’s moving toward the centre, it’s moving eastward \nand when it’s... and vice versa, you see.  So there’s a sort of actual... almost a herringbone \npattern of motion like this, that tends to concentrate momentum and keep the jet sharp. \n \nAnd people were very interested in this, because it had been shown from observations that \nthe atmosphere does it.  There’s a long history going back to Harold Jeffreys’ work [in the \n1920s].  But Victor Starr, who was another great luminary at MIT – I met him personally; he \nwas more in the twilight of his career then, I guess – but he’d done work in the ‘50s taking \nMichael McIntyre Page 95 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n95 \nthe newly available observations from upper-air soundings.  Because, as a result of the war, \npeople did these upper-air balloon soundings, so for the first time you had some sort of \ncoverage of upper-air motions.  And he showed that these motions always had these anti-\nfrictional  effects, that the jets were always sharpening themselves. \n \nAnd the great Edward N. Lorenz, who’s another luminary, who was at MIT there – I rubbed \nshoulders with a lot of famous people!  Ed Lorenz is one of the great legends, as the father of \nchaos theory.  And he was beginning to do that work then.  And he was a great guy too, one \nof these people who were after understanding and lucidity – is a most beautiful writer.  I’m \nsure he influenced me, my aspirations.  Well, Lorenz wrote a famous book on the general \ncirculation of the atmosphere, and at the end of that he says, there’s this strange thing \nwhere the eddies concentrate the momentum into the jets, as if you had negative viscosity, \nwhich is what Starr called it actually.  “Today we haven’t the faintest idea how this works” \n[said Lorenz in his book].  And Starr published a book that had a rather pretentious title, I \nthink, the Physics of Negative Viscosity Phenomena.  But what that book says is the same \nthing – that we see this thing happening, and we haven’t the faintest idea how [laughs].  No, \nthey didn’t claim to understand it at all. \n \nSo these instability problems with horizontal shear, they showed the same sort of thing.  So \na lot of us thought, that’s interesting to study because it looks like the beginning of an \nunderstanding of negative viscosity.  Now there’s a further chapter to that story, which I \nperhaps should talk about later, ’cause there’s a lot of stuff in between [resulting in, today, a \nvery clear understanding of how ‘negative viscosity’ works.] \n \nOkay, yeah.  So we’ll pick that up later.  But we’ve got to the point where you’ve been \nappointed a research assistant, although it’s got a different name, in 1969.  So we ought to \nexplore your decisions about what you studied.  You said you’ve got limited lecturing. \n \nYes, let’s... \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 96 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 2 \n \n96 \n[End of Track 2] \nMichael McIntyre Page 97 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 3 \n \n97 \nTrack 3 \n \nCould you say something about the development of your research having moved back to the \nUK as assistant director of research in 1969? \n \nOkay.  Well, my memories of that time aren’t very complete or accurate, but I think I spent \nsome time, you know, floundering around a bit, looking for new problems.  And I also had \nthis pull toward a musical career.  We did have a serious musical enterprise, I think it’s fair to \nsay.  It was a chamber group, a piano trio.  My wife is an absolutely wonderful pianist, and \nwe knew a wonderful cellist so we formed a piano trio and I think we delivered some world-\nclass performances.  And I did for a time think of having a second career alongside my \nscientific career, but I found in the end it was too much.  I didn’t have the time or the energy \nto really hold up both.  So that was part of the uncertainty at the time.  I mean, we did keep \nthe concerts going for several years, and I wouldn’t have missed it for worlds.  It was an \nabsolutely wonderful time. \n \n[0:01:15] \n \nAs regards science, I was, as I say, looking round for some new problem areas.  And I think \nwhat actually happened, looking back at my publications at the time, was that – being in this \nenvironment at Cambridge where all sorts of interesting fluid-dynamical problems were \ndiscussed in the weekly seminars – I learnt about some problems of flow of air over \nmountains, and their laboratory counterparts.  And there was an interesting technical issue \nin the laboratory counterparts. \n \nOkay, what sort of problem is this?  You have... This is a problem in which the Earth’s \nrotation is unimportant; everything happens too fast.  But you have in the atmosphere a \nstratified flow over a mountain.  It forms waves in the lee of the mountain; this is well known \nto glider pilots, who use them to gain altitude.  In the laboratory, there were various \nMichael McIntyre Page 98 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 3 \n \n98 \nsimplified versions of this, and a famous one was due to a man called Robert R. Long, who \nworked at John Hopkins University; and he did some famous experiments in a long [no pun \nintended] laboratory tanks [tank: a single tank of length about 6 metres].  And he put a stratified \nfluid in.  It was stratified with salt, I think.  And you let it settle down, and then you move a \nmountain along.  So it’s like flow past a mountain, except in a different frame of reference.  \nSo you get waves behind the mountain that depend on the stable stratification, like the real \nlee waves in the atmosphere. \n \nBut then a technical question arose about whether there was any disturbance ahead of the \nmountain or not.  This was called the problem of upstream influence.  And there was a lot of \nargument about it in these seminars at Cambridge.  So I was picking up that this was an \ninteresting piece of fluid dynamics.  And then one of the, you know, rather famous fluid \ndynamists in our group came up with a proof, as he claimed, that there was always such an \nupstream influence, in this laboratory version of the mountain-wave problem.  And that \nmeans that something called ‘Long’s hypothesis’ was wrong.  Long’s hypothesis was \nsomething that said there was no upstream influence; and he [Long] wanted this to be true \nbecause it led him [permitted him] to do some nice theory of waves of finite amplitude. \n \nBut anyway, this famous man – his name was Brooke Benjamin; he died some years ago \nsadly – he was a very clever creative thinker about fluids, and then rather famous, and he \nwas a Fellow of the Royal Society ages ago, and his name was Brooke Benjamin [as I said]; \nand he also composed music, although I never heard any of it.  But he came up with the \nclaim that he’d proved that you always had upstream influence.  And I got absolutely \nfascinated by this, because his proof didn’t give you the slightest clue about how it \nhappened.  But there were hints that it happened in a subtle way that wasn’t just to do with \nthe mountain hitting the fluid; it was a much more, sort of, indirect thing.  And to cut a long \nstory short, I studied this problem intensely and found that, yes, you usually did get \nupstream influence but not always – so the famous Brooke Benjamin was actually wrong on \none point.  And the way it happened was extraordinarily interesting because to see... to get \nit to happen, you had to do the problem of the wave train developing.  You actually had to \nconsider the time-dependent problem of how the waves started downstream of the \nmountain, and stretched out for increasingly large distances. \nMichael McIntyre Page 99 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 3 \n \n99 \n \nAnd it turned out that all the action was in the tail of the wave train – where the wave trains \nended [further and further downstream of the mountain].  There, there was a significant \ninteraction that sent a signal back to [toward] the mountain, and further upstream in some \ncases, but not in all cases.  So I think I actually sorted out how that problem worked.  And it \nwas exciting, because nobody had the faintest clue, before that, how it happened.  And I \npublished a paper called “On Long’s hypothesis of no upstream influence”, etc, etc.  That \nwas in 1972 that it came out [again in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics]. \n \nSorry, how in practice did you prove that there was this signal going from the point where \nthe waves end, back past the mountain?   \n \nWell, it was another example of doing the asymptotics.  I based the theory on the wave \namplitude being small; so that’s a shallow mountain, if you will.  And if you do that... if you \ndo that to what we call leading order, if you do the – you know, if you neglect everything \nthat’s of smaller order [also called ‘linearised theory’, or just ‘linear theory’] – then you just get \nthe result that the lee waves grow behind the mountain, and extend for longer and longer \ndistances.  I mean, this is... you’re imagining an infinitely long tank, if you will.  But nothing \nelse happens.  To get the upstream influence you’ve got to get the next correction, which is \nof the order of the square of the wave amplitude, which is much smaller.  And at that order \nthere’s this interaction in the tail of the lee wave train that sends upstream a long non-wavy \ndisturbance, except that it’s a bit like this equatorial undercurrent thing, you see.  So the \nhead of it propagates like a wave, but the rest is non-wavy and joins all the way to the back \n[the tail] of the lee wave train.  It’s quite a complicated thing to imagine. \n \nAnd did you do this... I mean, how did you do that calculation? \n \nOh, well, technically... well, I actually did it two different ways.  One was by solving what’s \ncalled an initial value problem, where you suddenly introduce the mountain, and that gets \nMichael McIntyre Page 100 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 3 \n \n100 \nquite technical.  You have to use things called integral transforms.  But I also did it by a \nmethod that makes things simpler, in which you introduce the mountain gradually.  And \nthen you’ve got what’s called a separation of timescales.  There’s the timescale for growing \nyour mountain, and you can make that a lot longer than the time for a particle to go through \none lee wave.  So there are two timescales in the problem.  Now if you make that your small \nparameter – the short time of the lee wave divided by the long time of growing the \nmountain – then you get significant simplifications.  And I ended up doing most of it that \nway, ’cause that was enough to get the essential result.  As I recall, I showed [that] you get \nessentially the same result anyway.  So I had it two ways. \n \n[0:08:09] \n \nAnd how at this time did you organise home and work life, if you like?  You were presumably \nliving in Cambridge and working in the Department?  I don’t know if that’s the right way to \nput it.  But how did home and work relate to each other?  How did you organise your day, if \nyou... ?   \n \nWell, when I think about it, I must... it boggles the mind how I managed to do everything I \ndid, because I had these three stepchildren at home and I had to try and, you know, give \nthem some attention and my wife some attention.  And we still had this secondary career in \nmusic as well, so I had to make sure I did a certain amount of violin practice every evening, \nespecially if a concert was approaching [laughs].  And I think I still had my college research \nfellowship or...  At some point around then, I switched to a teaching fellowship.  So for a \nwhile I was doing college supervisions as well.  And the answer to your question is, I haven’t \na clue how I managed all that.  I mean, young people have a lot more energy than us oldies \n[laughs].  I couldn’t do it now, for sure. \n \nAnd what was your wife doing while you were... ? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 101 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 3 \n \n101 \nWell, she was looking after the kids and the home, and practising the piano for our concerts, \nand doing quite a bit of piano teaching as well.  [And doing all the shopping.]  So again, that \nboggles the mind.  I don’t know how she did it either.   \n \n[0:09:31] \n \nAnd then after the mountain jet work, what was next in your research? \n \nOkay.  Well, this mountain – this sort of mountain lee-wave problem – this got me interested \nin these subtle effects when waves of a certain amplitude produce very different effects at \nthe next order, as I’ve described.  And I realised that there was a lot of interesting and subtle \nstuff going on.  And I think it must have been around then that I remembered that when I \nwas still a research student Francis Bretherton had another student, called Chris Garrett – \nwho’s now a famous theoretical oceanographer – but his PhD thesis was almost \ncontemporary with mine; he was working on these subtle wave effects.  So I remembered \nthat.  And I also ran into a paper of Francis himself, where he had discussed some aspects of \nhow mountain lee waves would have systematic mean effects.  And my lee-wave tail effect \nwas actually a slight variation on that theme.  It was really a bit different but it was another \nexample of what we call second-order mean effects of waves. \n \nAnd... to cut a long story short, it began gradually to dawn on me that effects of this sort \nmight really be significant in the atmosphere.  I think I owe this to Francis.  Francis \nrecognised it.  That’s why he worked on the problem, because... alright, mountain lee \nwaves... some of them go upwards as well as downstream, so some of them penetrate to \ngreat heights.  And there are systematic mean effects.  And, in a nutshell, what it... what \nthey mean is that the atmosphere can feel a systematic force at great heights where those \nwaves dissipate, even though the force is being exerted by the mountains.  So you exert a \nforce in one place, and the atmosphere –at least as far as its mean motion is concerned – the \natmosphere feels it in another place, which might be much higher up.  And it turns out that \nthat’s often very important for understanding even the gross features of the circulation.  By \nMichael McIntyre Page 102 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 3 \n \n102 \nthe time you get up to, you know, fifty or a hundred kilometres, these effects can be very \nimportant. \n \nAnd I think that’s probably what began to get me interested in the upper atmosphere, \nmeaning the stratosphere and, you know, those sorts of higher altitudes, as well as the wave \nproblems.  And in fact, my first research student, who was a marvellous guy called Adrian \nSimmons, who’s now a luminary in the numerical weather forecasting business – he’s a \nleader at the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts – and I got him to work \non problems of large-scale waves in the stratosphere, not mountain lee waves but \nsomething called Rossby waves, because while I was still at MIT I’d learnt of some work by... \nwell  [backtracking], there was a pioneering paper by Jule Charney again – who’d pioneered a \nlot of things – he and a man called Philip Drazin wrote a famous paper on these large-scale \nRossby waves that go up into the stratosphere.  I’ll have to explain what those are later, I \nthink.  But, you know, if you think of the planetary scale, if you think of a wave whose \nwavelength is, you know, halfway round the Earth or something like that, that’s... and... \num... [getting back to the main point]  then a guy at MIT who was... I think he was still a student \nof Victor Starr’s, or he might have been a postdoc, very smart guy...  His name was Bob – \nhe’s still alive; he’s still doing interesting work – his name is Bob Dickinson.  And he was \ninterested in this kind of problem.  And he wrote a paper called, what was it, “Planetary-\nscale Rossby waves propagating  in [vertically through] weak westerly [wind] waveguides”. \n \nAnd he was interested in how these waves might get into the real stratosphere in... taking a \nstep further than Charney and Drazin, in making more realistic models of these waves \ngetting up.  Because it was beginning to be clear that understanding this was very important \nfor understanding things you observe about the stratosphere, in particular the difference \nbetween the winter stratosphere and the summer stratosphere.  [The winter stratosphere is \nhighly disturbed – nothing like a simple flow around latitude circles – whereas the summer \nstratosphere is remarkably undisturbed and close to being around latitude circles, at altitudes roughly \n20–40 kilometres.] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 103 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 3 \n \n103 \nThis, by the way, is the thing that Fred Hoyle got wrong.  He didn’t know there was any such \ndifference.  But anyway, the winter stratosphere is much more disturbed, and even today \nwe still... it’s still clear that that’s because of these planetary-scale Rossby waves, even \nthough we [now] know far more about how they work in detail.  And that I’ll come to later. \n \nSo anyway, there was this paper by Dickinson.  It turned out that Dickinson had sort of done \nthe problem half right, but not quite.  So I set Adrian Simmons on to this problem, and he did \na more accurate version of Dickinson’s work, and got us a bit closer to realistic models of \nthese Rossby waves in the stratosphere.  And by the way, Adrian was an absolutely ideal \nresearch student.  Here was I, as a naïve young Assistant Director of Research, as I was then, \ntaking on my first research student.  And I would suggest a problem, and Adrian would go \naway, and come back a week later with a neatly worked out answer to whatever the \nquestion was.  And he was very self-contained, and organised himself very well, and it went \nthat way throughout his [PhD] work. \n \nAnd when I got my next research student, whose name I forget [laughs], it was a terrible \nshock ’cause I thought that all Cambridge research students were like Adrian Simmons, and \nwould all just perfectly do whatever you suggested [laughs].  As I said, Adrian is now a great \nluminary in numerical weather forecasting.  He was very much involved in developing the \nmodels on which today’s weather forecasts depend, which are, I think everybody would \nagree, not perfect [inevitably, thanks to the Ed Lorenz ‘butterfly effect’], but very, very much \nbetter than they used to be when Adrian and I were young.  So that’s another great scientific \nand technical story.   \n \nAnd so you directed him in work on the Rossby waves? \n \nYeah, he did these stratospheric Rossby waves.  So that must have been, I think, the real \nbeginning of my interest in the stratosphere.  I did publish a little paper [also apropos of the \nstratosphere] on this thing that Jule Charney actually got wrong [laughs].  It turned out not to \nbe the most important aspect, but there was another instability problem that some people \nMichael McIntyre Page 104 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 3 \n \n104 \nthought was important for the stratosphere.  And there was a paper by Charney and Stern \nthat’s very famous, published in 1962, that said that this stability problem... this instability \ndidn’t work.  He thought he’d proved that this particular shear flow was stable, and I realised \nthat was wrong because there was a sign error in the... I could do this because I’d studied \nthese shear instability problems enough, by then, to have a pretty good grasp of how they \nworked.  I could see it was wrong, so I published a little paper with the correct solution in it, \nin the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society.  That came out in ’70... when \nwas it?  ’71, I think, was it?  Or was it ’72?  Yeah, it was ’72 – okay – which was actually the \nsame year as the paper I published on the upstream-influence effect of mountain lee waves.  \nSo I had these two different things I was interested in  [– the lee-wave problem, and an \nembryonic interest in the stratosphere as such.  I should add that the 1962 Charney and Stern paper \nwas correct, and interesting, in many other ways!] \n \nBut I think the bottom line here is that I was beginning to be more and more interested in \nthe mean effects of waves.  Not just the waves themselves, as in Adrian Simmons’ thesis, but \nactually what systematic mean effects they might have.  And just to cut... fast forward for a \nmoment, it turns out that these big Rossby waves are absolutely critical to understanding \npractically everything about the stratospheric circulation – such as how the ozone moves \naround, and all the other chemicals, how the ozone hole forms – all that story.  Those Rossby \nwaves are basic to that.  But you have to take it further, and understand their systematic \nmean effects.  Now I didn’t really understand all that then, but I was beginning to be \nfascinated by the systematic mean effects, because they were mathematically interesting. \n \n[0:17:56] \n \nCould you just define systematic mean effect?  What is a... what would be the systematic \nmean effect of a wave? \n \nThat’s a good question.  You know the... okay.  It’s a little subtle how that arises in the lee-\nwave problem, but you remember I said that the tails of the lee waves send this non-wavy \nMichael McIntyre Page 105 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 3 \n \n105 \ndisturbance.  So by comparison to the waves, that’s sort of a mean – a change in the mean \nflow, this upstream-influence thing.  So that’s one clue.  But perhaps a simpler illustration is \nsomething that anyone can do in the kitchen sink, which is, you put a thin layer of water in \nthe kitchen sink, and you sprinkle some dry tea leaves on it and you jiggle with a little \nwavemaker [a fat highlighter pen would do] at about five [cycles] per second, so you make short \nwaves on the surface.  And it’s very easy to show that, when you do that, you generate a \nstrong mean flow.  The tea leaves move away from the wavemaker.  And it’s very \nconspicuous, and very robust. \n \nI do this in lectures quite often and I get the audience’s attention by saying, “This \nexperimental demonstration never fails,” I say.  And I can see the ears pricking up.  And then \nI do it, and it doesn’t fail, ’cause it is very robust.  And what’s happening is that the waves, \nwhich are, at leading order... if you do the linear theory, the leading-order theory [for small \nwave amplitude], you just get that the fluid particles jiggle back and forth – this is what you \nread in any physics textbook – but if you do it to the next order you see, actually, there’s a \nsystematic mean motion.  And some of that’s due to the waves dissipating, and some of it’s \ndue to something called the ‘Stokes drift’, which is a technicality which I don’t think we need \nto bother with.  What’s more important is that the dissipation of the waves gives a \nsystematic mean effect, which is a lot of this... part of this jet that goes away from the \nwavemaker.  Just in case someone knows about Stokes drifts, let me add that if you stop the \nwavemaker the mean flow carries on.  That proves it’s not [entirely] a Stokes drift.  A Stokes \ndrift is a temporary mean flow that depends on the waves being present. \n \nSo this – in the example then of the tea on the surface of the water, you’ve got a jet which is \nmoving the little leaves of tea... \n \nYes. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 106 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 3 \n \n106 \n… which shows that the waves aren’t simply sort of... when you do the waves with a \nwavemaker, it’s not just simply circling and producing no general motion in a particular \ndirection. \n \nYeah, the particles aren’t... they are jiggling, but they’re also drifting along, carrying the tea \nleaves with them, so there’s a systematic mean flow.  That’s what I mean. \n \nAnd it’s quite fast in relation to the... it seems quite... when you look at the demonstration \nthat you showed me, they seem to move quite quickly, away... \n \nYes.  When you do the theory it looks like a small [second-order] correction, but when you do \nthe experiment you’re actually using quite a large wave amplitude, so actually that \ncorrection is quite significant.  And really to do it accurately you need higher corrections.  \nBut the second order is enough to show you the qualitative nature of the effect.  And there’s \na beautiful, you know, general theory of this, which is something I worked on quite hard in \nthe following years. \n \n[End of Track 3] \n \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n107 \nTrack 4 \n \nAt the end of the last session we’d got to the point where you’d been working outside of \nscience to some extent, in professional music, as well as being employed to research in the \nDepartment of Mathematics at Cambridge.  And we’d considered some work on air moving \npast a mountain.  And I wondered whether you could continue to describe what it is you were \nfocusing on in your research, at this time. \n \nYes.  Well, to be honest, at that time I wasn’t completely focused on one thing.  There’s a \nslight digression – let me mention – I was working on musical acoustics with a wonderful \nresearch student called Jim Woodhouse, who still works on that, and is [now] a Professor in \nthe Engineering Department here.  But I’d better not get off on that, because it’ll be a \ndistraction. \n \nCertainly one of my interests were these... what I think we’ll have to call ‘second-order mean \neffects’ of waves.  Remember, ‘order’ in this technical jargon means [refers to] the wave \namplitude.  So a first-order theory [a linear theory] is the sort you see in physics textbooks, \nwhere you assume the wave amplitude is small, and don’t try to compute any corrections.  \nAnd in that sort of theory, if you have water waves, for example, the theory says that the \nparticles of water go round in little circles, or ellipses, and... just... closed orbits.  And the \nwater doesn’t move anywhere, on average. \n \nAnd if you do the second-order correction, which means corrections of the order of the \nsquare of the wave amplitude – this is a standard mathematical technique you can use to get \na refinement of the theory – well, I was interested in the fact that, when you do that, you \nget all sorts of new and interesting effects, one of which is this mean flow that you see \ncreated by the wavemaker in the kitchen sink.  And I’ve often demonstrated that in lectures, \nand [as I said last time] I always say to the audience, “This experimental demonstration never \nfails.  It’s very robust.”  And I always get their attention ’cause everybody knows experiments \ndone in lectures can often go wrong.  But it does never fail, because it is robust, and it’s easy \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n108 \nfor anyone to do.  And I recommend anyone interested to try it because... I always think one \nof the most wonderful things about science is that some things are things that can be \nverified by anyone. \n \nSo, okay, I’m talking about the mean flows generated by waves.  Remember, the textbooks \nsay, the particles go round in little circles or ellipses.  The second-order correction refines \nthat and says, no, no, the particles actually drift along.  They’re still going round in almost \nlittle circles, but they drift along.  And now come the subtleties.  There is a... more than one \nsort of second-order mean effects, that give rise to mean currents.  And some of them \ndepend on the waves being there.  There’s a piece of technical jargon, they’re called Stokes \ndrifts.  But there’s another component that adds to the Stokes drift that depends on the \nwaves dissipating, and that’s actually of greater interest because, as long as the waves are \ndissipating, this effect is, as it were, cumulative.  If I do a thought-experiment where I start \nsending waves in somewhere – and they dissipate somewhere else – where the waves are \ndissipating there is a systematic force being exerted that depends on the wave dissipation \nand, if nothing else is happening, the fluid there accelerates.  There’s a growing mean flow. \n \nSo even if the wave amplitude is small, if you wait long enough, you can still get a significant \nmean flow.  So we focus attention on that kind of thing as a highly significant kind of second-\norder mean effect, and it is important, we now know, for understanding practically \neverything about large-scale circulations in the atmosphere, and almost certainly the oceans \nas well, although it’s far less well developed for the oceans.  That’s an active research area.  \nSo I was beginning to see that point in the early ’70s, and getting interested in these \nproblems, following the lead of my erstwhile supervisor, Francis Bretherton, who had \npreviously seen the point about these problems and started working on them. \n \nAnd so what I did was... take it up where he left off, and [working with a student of mine, David \nAndrews] develop a general theoretical framework that proved to be very powerful in \nunderstanding these cumulative mean effects of waves.  It’s got its own jargon.  It’s \nnowadays called the ‘generalised Lagrangian-mean theory’ of wave mean flow interaction.  \nSorry, that’s a terrible mouthful.   \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n109 \n \n[0:04:51] \n \nBut it’s very interesting for a theoretician like me because, to get the powerful results and \nsee what’s general – and what’s special to a particular problem – you need to use what we \ncall the Lagrangian description of fluid motion.  Okay, this is a short tutorial.  This is standard \nfluid mechanics [laughs]. \n \nIf you... there are two... essentially two basic ways of describing fluid motion.  One is what a \nphysicist would call field theory [and fluid dynamicists call it the Eulerian description].  You watch \nthe fluid going past, you focus attention on one point at a time, and at each point in the fluid \nthere’s a pressure and a density and a velocity and a temperature, and so on.  And you \ndescribe everything in terms of what all those things are at each point.  And that’s what’s \ncalled field theory – just how you do electromagnetism, where you have a magnetic field at \na certain point, and so on. \n \nBut in fluids there’s another natural way to describe things, which is to follow individual \nparticles [and it’s called the Lagrangian description], and in these wave problems, of course, the \nparticles are jiggling back and forth as well as possibly drifting systematically.  So now there’s \na nontrivial problem.  You want to capture the jiggling part in a Lagrangian way – it turns out \nthat if you follow the fluid particles, all sorts of theoretical results become far, far simpler.  I \ncan give you some specific examples where, to do a particular theory [a calculation for a \nparticular case of wave–mean interaction], it might take, you know, several dozen pages of \ncomplicated equations to do it from the Eulerian perspective, but only half a page to do it \nfrom the sort of Lagrangian perspective that we developed.  [My favourite example is what’s \ncalled the Craik–Leibovich theory of Langmuir circulations.] \n \nWe at first... was... well, Francis Bretherton really began it, but he didn’t take it very far, and \nI and my student David Andrews took it a lot further and reached this systematic general \ntheoretical framework, this so-called generalised Lagrangian-mean theory.  And the trick was \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n110 \nto describe the waves in a Lagrangian way, but the mean flow in an Eulerian way, so you \ncould then have a picture, and a set of equations that agreed with that picture, in which \nthe... you could watch a point and its neighbourhood and see the fluid particles oscillating, \nbut also drifting past.  So you could talk about the wave displacement, which is a Lagrangian \nquantity [describing the jiggling back and forth], but do this trick of describing the displacement, \nand the mean flow, ‘at’ a particular point as well.  So technically it’s what we call a hybrid, \nEulerian–Lagrangian, description.  And as I say, this proved very powerful, for various \nreasons. \n \nThis is going to get awfully technical but, let me just mention, the most basic [reason] is \nsomething called Kelvin’s circulation theorem.  And it’s important because if you have a \nwave motion that isn’t dissipating, there’s all sorts of things that can’t happen – you know, \nyou can’t get some of these mean effects that I was talking about.  And the reason is this \nthing called Kelvin’s circulation theorem.   And what it says is that if you take a... not just a \nparticle, but a line of particles in the fluid [a so-called ‘material contour’], which would simply \nundulate according to a linear wave theory, there’s a quantity you can compute, which is \nsomething like a measure of the mean velocity along that line.  So you’re taking an average \nalong a wiggly line, you see.  And that quantity has to be a constant [for non-dissipative fluid \nmotion].  This was proved by Lord Kelvin back in the nineteenth century, and it’s basic to a \nwhole lot of other fluid problems as well.  So the hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian description \ncaptured the effects of Kelvin’s circulation theorem in a rather neat and simple way, and \nthat’s why it was powerful in saying whether you get, you know, cumulative effects from \nwave dissipation or not. \n \nAnd by the way, it also... it did something else that’s very fundamental.  It told you how to \nthink of wave breaking, in a fundamental way that applies to all cases.  If you think of \nbreaking waves... obviously if waves break, as on an ocean beach, that’s a case of how waves \ndissipate.  And so you could sort of guess that that’s going to be significant for mean-flow \nproblems.  But it turns out that the most fundamental and penetrating way to describe wave \nbreaking is to consider the material contours that would simply undulate in [according to] a \nlinear wave theory, and decide whether or not they deform irreversibly [in nonlinear reality]. \n \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n111 \nIf they’re deforming irreversibly – getting twisted up like spaghetti on a fork, or churned \naround in a horribly complicated way by the turbulence in the wave breaking – if that’s \nhappening, Kelvin’s circulation theorem, or at least its simple application, fails.   That’s one \nway to see when you’re going to get significant dissipative mean flow effects.  So... together \nwith a colleague of mine, Tim Palmer, who is actually now a luminary, and he’s a big name, \nin numerical weather prediction – he helped to pioneer the ensemble prediction that allows \nus to assess the uncertainty of weather [forecasts] – he’s a very smart guy, he’s done all sorts \nof interesting things, including some fascinating work on the foundations of quantum \nmechanics.  Well, in those days when Tim and I were young, we worked together on this \nidea of wave breaking as applied to Rossby waves.  This is jumping ahead, now, to the \nRossby waves in the stratosphere. \n \nAnd perhaps I should come back to that, ’cause it’s a great scientific story, but the bottom \nline is we used this idea, that Kelvin’s circulation theorem, and generalised Lagrangian-mean \ntheory, tells you how to decide whether a wave is breaking or not.  And that criterion applies \nto all the sorts of waves that are important in the atmosphere and ocean, so it’s quite \nimportant. \n \nYes, so we’ll come back to that when that happens, when this work with Tim Palmer \nhappens. \n \nYes. \n \n[0:10:57] \n \nAnd so – but in terms of your work at the moment, we’ve got up to working on this \ngeneralised Lagrangian-mean theory with David Andrews... \n \nYes. \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n112 \n \nAnd I was wondering, when you said that this was another way to see waves, I wondered to \nwhat extent you were experimenting in a laboratory or elsewhere with fluids and liquids. \n \nWell, okay.  You must remember, I’m just a humble theoretician and I don’t... I’m not really a \nprofessional experimenter.  But on the other hand, I am a scientifically-minded person, so I \nlike to do little experiments of my own, including this kitchen sink thing, and the little things I \ndo in lectures, which are actually a wonderful way to make something vivid and more \nunderstandable.  So... I’m always doing thought-experiments.  That’s a terribly important \nthing for a theoretician to do, because part of our job, it always seems to me, is not just to \nadvance understanding but to try and discern what’s robust about a simplified theory.  And \nyou’ve got to do thought-experiments to see that kind of point. \n \nI mean, okay, I was talking about pictures.  I was beginning to talk about equations, I think.  \nAnd let me just say, I would argue that understanding a problem – you know, practically any \nscientific problem – should consist in seeing it from as many angles as possible: from \nequations, from pictures, from feelings, from doing thought-experiments and real \nexperiments.  It’s just a child playing, poking things to see how they work.  All good science is \nlike that.  And I say this, but I’m in good company because people like Richard Feynman have \nsaid it.  And if anyone’s interested, there’s an absolutely wonderful description of this in \nJames Gleick’s book on Feynman.  It’s called Genius, and there’s a wonderful passage in \nthere where he describes Feynman trying to understand something.  Feynman himself talks \nabout this quite a bit in his popular lectures.  But it’s exactly this thing of seeing it from \nseveral angles, trying to make mental pictures, trying to see it from the equations, and so on.  \nEinstein always talked about feeling things, as well as calculating them and visualising them. \n \n[0:13:13] \n \nIf we could sort of hover above you then unknown in the late ’60s and early ’70s when you’re \ndeveloping generalised Lagrangian-mean theory, what would we see you doing? \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n113 \n \nOh, you’d be bored to tears.  What you’d see would be me sort of scribbling lots of \nequations on papers, and banging my head and... uttering grunts of frustration.  Because \ntechnically this theory was quite complicated.  We had to get – this is both David Andrews \nand I – we had to get our head around quite a lot of at first unfamiliar mathematics.  It grew \nout of, as I said, the Lagrangian description.  That’s a classic and well known thing.  But in \nfact it was an effort to get on top of it, because it wasn’t very often used.  I think that’s one \nreason why what we did was a significant bit of pioneering, because we were applying this to \na... in a somewhat new area, as I say, a hybrid of Eulerian and Lagrangian. \n \nSo we had to get our heads around how to say that mathematically, which isn’t trivial.  I \nmean, now you can get beautiful... or at least one beautiful book about it, by my ex-student \nOliver Bühler.  There’s a... it is a beautiful book.  It’s called Waves and Mean Flows.  It’s a \nbook that... well, I said at first, the book I meant to write.  For years I planned to write a book \non this but never got round to finishing it; and as Oliver’s book developed I first said, “Ah, \nthis is the book I wished I’d written.”  But when he got to the end it was, “Ah, this is the book \nI wish I could have written,” because Oliver had a great flair for putting things in a vivid and \nwitty and interesting way that I don’t have myself.  So if anyone is really interested in this \ntopic I recommend his book, Waves and Mean Flows.  It was published in 2009, if I recall \ncorrectly [laughs].  So you could say the subject has come to a certain maturity now, and it’s \nsort of... a number of people do understand how to use the theory, and it is being used on \nnew problems now, but it took a long time. \n \n[0:15:17] \n \nAnd as well as seeing you sitting with bits of paper, banging your head, were there other \nplaces where you went to do this work or... ? \n \nWell, that’s an interesting question.  Some of it I did on a sidewalk café in Nice.  I was already \ngetting interested in solar astrophysics – although none of that came to fruition till a long \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n114 \ntime later – but I did get pulled into one or two conferences.  And at the Observatoire de \nNice they had a beautiful library where they held a conference one year that I was at, \nsomething about the Sun’s vibrations.  That’s another great scientific story, by the way, \nwhich I may... I’d like to say a bit about that later on. \n \nBut we loved Nice, you know, the south of France, all the sunshine and the wonderful food \nand the frothy coffee and everything – the beautiful buildings.  There’s a wonderful \nmuseum.  It’s called the Chagall Museum [the home of Marc Chagall’s Message Biblique \npaintings].  It’s got Chagall stained glass [a whole sidewall made of blueish stained glass] in a little \nconcert room.  We played a concert in there once, by the way.  They had a beautiful piano.  \nIn fact I think it was part of this conference.  We got engaged – we were still... still had our \nprofessional piano trio – and we were engaged to play a concert for the conference in the \nlittle concert room in the Chagall Museum.  That was a wonderful occasion [laughs]. \n \nBut anyway, so... you asked where would I work, you see, and I know one of the ideas I had \nthat popped up and helped us get our heads round this theory did occur to me on a sidewalk \ncafé in Nice.  It was something called the ‘transformed Eulerian mean’, which actually grew \ninto another important bit of theory that’s widely used, which I don’t think I’m even... going \nto even try to describe.  It was just a mathematical... a rather simple mathematical trick that \nhas proved to be very useful.   \n \nHow do you know that it was there that this occurred to you in your memory?  When you say \nthat it occurred... that this developed... \n \nWell, that’s my memory.  Memory can play tricks.  But I do remember sitting in this  café and \nhaving a eureka moment and saying, oh gosh, let’s make this transformation, that’ll simplify \neverything in a very nice way.  And it did [laughs]. \n \nWho were you with? \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n115 \n \nI was by myself. \n \nAnd were you sitting thinking or actually working with... ? \n \nOh, I had this nice cup of big frothy coffee, a grand café au lait [or grand café crème], or \nwhatever they call it [laughs], and sort of mulling over some theoretical puzzles.  This is... it \nalways works this way.  You struggle with something, and you bang your head, and you get \nstuck, and then you’ve got to take a break.  And you might be doing something completely \ndifferent like sitting on a sidewalk café, or in the shower, or the loo, or whatever it is, and \nsuddenly an idea pops up.  I think anyone who does creative work has this experience, a sort \nof ping-pong between the conscious and the unconscious.  You’ve got to have the frustration \nof getting stuck, to stimulate the unconscious to do something.  And that’s, I think, what \nhappened on this occasion; it happened with something else as well in the GLM, the \ngeneralised Lagr... can I call it GLM theory? \n \nYes, referring to generalised Lagrarian-mean theory. \n \nLagrangian-mean, yes, generalised Lagrangian-mean.  I’m going to call it GLM, probably, \nfrom now on. \n \nGLM, yeah. \n \nAnd there was a little thing slotted into place in that, too [GLM], when I was... I don’t know \nwhether it was the same session on the sidewalk café, but I just have this memory of a nice \nNice sunshine and the pleasant weather [and frothy coffee!]. \n \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n116 \nSo... you know... If you’re interested in this sort of thing [creativity, innovation], there’s a lot of \nwonderful stuff about it in Littlewood’s Mathematician’s Miscellany.  The great \nmathematical analyst John E Littlewood wrote this little book of snippets of witty \nobservations on this and that, but he’s got some... a section called The Mathematician’s Life \nof Work, I think [actually The Mathematician’s Art of Work – in the Bollobás edition only], and he \ntalks about how different individuals work well in different situations.  Littlewood says, I \nwork best when going for a walk, you know.  [That’s only part of it; he would also work “all out” \non paper at a desk.]  It’s the same thing though; you struggle with something and get stuck, \nand then you go for a walk.  And he’s got one story where he recalls he almost heard his \nsubconscious shouting at him, try this, you fool [laughs].  And, he says, the tension, until I \ncould get back and verify – ’cause he had to get it on paper and really see that it worked – \nthe tension was nevertheless... considerable, before I could get back and verify, he says.  \nThis, by the way, has been republished under the editorship of a man called Bollobás, \nBéla Bollobás.  He’s a pure mathematician here [at Cambridge] who published Littlewood’s... \nthe original thing was out of print long ago, and this is a republication with extra bits added, \nincluding a picture of Darwin playing his – this is Erasmus Darwin – playing the trombone to \nhis tulips [what he called a ‘damn-fool experiment’, something that a scientist should try every so \noften].  Might come to that later [laughs]. \n \n[On checking the Bollobás edition of the Miscellany I find that my memory of the story just recounted, \nwhile correct in essence, draws on two stories from different chapters.  In The Mathematician’s Art of \nWork Littlewood writes, “I had a sense that my subconscious was saying,   ‘Are you never going to do \nit, confound you;  try this’.”   And in a separate but similar story at the end of  the chapter entitled  A \nMathematical Education,  “... a flooding certainty came into my mind that the thing was done.  The 40 \nminutes before I got back and could verify were none the less tense.” ] \n \nWhen you try to... one of the things that you say when you’re thinking about what it really \nmeans to understand something, and thinking about Feynman as well, is that you try to... \nyou said that you try to see things and calculate them and feel them, do you... does that \ninvolve... doing... understanding in different ways like that – does that involve doing different \nthings? \n \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n117 \nIt does sort of, although most of it... for a theoretician, mostly the ‘doing’ is in one’s head – \nthought-experiments, if you will.  You say, okay, I’ve just got an equation, what does this \nmean?  It means that if I do this, something else will happen.  So you try to understand the \nimplication of the equation.  You know, that’s different from just reading the terms in the \nequation, and checking that the signs are right, and so on.   \n \n[0:20:50] \n \nThank you.  So having worked out GLM, where did that take you in terms of your work next?  \nHow did you use this GLM to do something else, to move things... understanding on? \n \nYes, okay.  Well, of course, having developed this general framework, I was naturally \ninterested in how it applied in particular cases.  And, gosh, here’s where memory is slightly \nletting me down.  I’m sure what I must have done was sort of look around all over the place, \nand see if I could spot any interesting problems [beyond those I’d already encountered, such as \nmountain lee waves and stratospheric Rossby waves].  I know I thought about water waves, \nordinary surface gravity waves, the sort that come into ocean beaches, ’cause they’re quite \ninteresting in many ways.  And the standard theories of those, at the time, tended to neglect \nthe sort of mean effects from dissipating waves that our theory gave us a better handle on.  \nSo I did think a bit about those. \n \nI think I published – well, I published at least one paper on water waves.  The theory, for \ninstance, told you that, if you build up waves on the surface of the ocean, the mean surface \nheight changes.  This was of interest to people doing radar altimetry of the sea surface.  I’ve \nlost track of the subject a bit, so I’m not sure whether that proved really important.  But I \nhave a little paper called On the Divergence Effect... [Full title in gory detail: A note on the \ndivergence effect and the Lagrangian-mean surface elevation in water waves].  This was more from \na theoretician’s viewpoint, about...  Oh gosh, I’d better talk technical for a moment.  I don’t \nthink it’s overwhelmingly important, but divergence means... okay, if you think of the flow of \na gas, it can expand and get less dense, so the velocity can, as it were, go outwards from a \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n118 \nparticular particle.  That’s what we call divergence.  It has a precise mathematical meaning.  \nHowever, if the fluid is not a gas but more like water, it’s more nearly incompressible, so it’s \nvery hard for it to be divergent in that sense.  And we call this ‘incompressible flow’, and we \noften assume that it’s exactly incompressible.  That’s quite an accurate idealisation for things \nlike water waves. \n \nAnd the Lagrangian-mean, the GLM, theory tells you that, even though the actual flow is \nincompressible, and free of divergence, the mean flow can nevertheless be divergent, which \nis a bit of a surprise.  It surprised, you know, people... actually, you’re going to interview \nMichael Longuet-Higgins.  It surprised him like anything [laughs].  But anyway... so, as a \nresult, I published a little paper showing that that was the case.  It was easy enough to see \nfrom the [GLM] equations.  And, well, that’s about all. \n \n[0:23:37] \n \nIn deciding to think about, for example, waves breaking on beaches, was it necessary to go to \nbeaches, or was the choice of that as something to apply GLM to inspired by being at a \nbeach, or seeing a beach to any extent? \n \nWell, I’ve always used the image of waves breaking on a beach as a kind of conceptual peg to \nhang quite a lot of other things on, ’cause they’re such... they’re so visible, these ocean \nwaves.  Everyone has a mental picture of those.  And, okay, here’s an example.  There was a \nhuge number of papers written on something called critical-layer theory, and that’s about... \nmostly about the mountain sort of waves that we were talking about before – the waves \nwhose... that owe their existence to the fluid being stably stratified, the gradient of... \ntechnically it’s something called potential density.  Never mind: heavy fluid below light fluid, \nwith a continuous gradient.  And so that [the fluid] wants to lie on flat [horizontal] surfaces; so \nif you disturb it there’s a wave motion.  We call them ‘internal gravity waves’. \n \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n119 \nNow... if you send these gravity waves into a shear flow – remember, we talked about \nvertical shear – well, if you have such a shear flow, and if it happens that the flow speed at a \ncertain altitude agrees with the horizontal phase speed of the waves... What does that \nmean?  It means, if you take a horizontal slice through the fluid, you’ll see moving wave \ncrests, and that that [the crests’] velocity is what I mean by the ‘horizontal phase speed’... the \n[there’s a] technical issue about defining that carefully.  Now if that agrees with the fluid flow \nspeed at a certain altitude, we have what’s called a critical level.  And if you do the linear \nwave theory in that case – and as a matter of fact, my supervisor, Francis Bretherton, wrote \none of the important papers on that – if you do   that linear theory, you get this mysterious-\nsounding result that the waves seem to be absorbed at the critical layer, without having to \ndissipate them. \n \nBut actually that’s a deceptive thing, because the theory, if you look more carefully, predicts \nits own breakdown – which is often one of the most interesting things about a theoretician’s \nwork, noticing this.  And what it’s telling you is that the waves are actually going to break \nbefore they get to the critical layer – yes?   And you can see this if you go into the detail of \nthe wave dynamics.  So it isn’t so mysterious any more. \n \nTwo points, one is, the waves break, and therefore they really do dissipate, even though you \nthought at first the theory wasn’t allowing for that.  And second, the waves don’t actually \nreach the critical layer; they break before they get there.  And still, in the literature, there’s a \nmyth that keeps persisting, that talks about waves being absorbed ‘at’ critical layers [critical \nlevels, I should have said], ’cause people haven’t looked any further than the simplistic linear \ntheory [laughs].  But, you see, the ocean-beach image is helpful in understanding that, \nbecause the way you get the waves apparently being absorbed at the critical layer is, you \nassume the amplitude is very small; it’s a first-order theory.  But for it to really apply \naccurately, the wave [amplitude]... it has to be microscopically small.  The smallness \nrequirement is very, very severe.  So it’s like the ocean beach where you had tiny waves that \ndon’t break until they just about reach your toes, at the water’s edge.  That’s what the \ncritical-layer [theory] is talking about.  And now you understand: in the real world, that’s not \nvery interesting.  In the real world, you’ve got a whacking great surf zone of violently \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n120 \nbreaking waves, much further out.  And similarly, for gravity-wave critical layers, you’ve got \nviolently breaking waves before they get to the critical layer [laughs].  \n \n[0:27:27] \n \nI see.  Yes, okay.  So having done a bit of applying it in that way, where else did you apply \nGLM?   \n \nWell, one of the things that... here’s where it starts to kind of spread out a bit, because, you \nknow, some other people were interested, and I’m beginning to lose track of exactly who \nwas working on what.  But the sort of thing that we, you know, gradually started to \nunderstand was... well, let’s take this gravity-wave case with the waves breaking, before \nthey get to critical layer, or for some other reason.  There are other reasons why they can \nbreak, such as the density falling off.  And so the thought-experiment is, send the waves up... \nand this, by the way, is a useful thought-experiment for understanding the effects of real \nmountain waves that exert real forces higher up in the real atmosphere.  And this is actually \nbuilt into weather-forecasting models these days, and has a significant effect.  So it is \nimportant to understand it. \n \nSo think of a... do a thought-experiment where we idealise a bit.  We... well, the simplest \nversion of this is take an infinite row of mountains in an infinite channel, so you get waves \nthat just undulate in the downwind direction, or the... I shouldn’t say downwind, I should... \nit’s actually upwind technically.  It’s in the... along the channel [upwind and downwind].  \nYou’ve got undulations, and a simple mathematical model – it’s just a sine function – so \nyou’ve got sinusoidal mountains extending from, let’s say, [from] x is minus infinity to x [is] \nplus infinity [laughs].  And you turn on these mountains... you do a thought-experiment \nwhere you start this going with no waves in the fluid, and the waves propagate into the fluid \nand propagate upwards.  And if there’s a critical layer, or a decrease in density, they’ll break \nat some point. \n \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n121 \nNow the GLM theory tells you the following thing, that... well, let’s say two things.  It says \nthat, where the waves are breaking – if you keep sending them up persistently – the mean \nflow will accelerate cumulatively.  It’ll be a cumulative change.  This is what I was saying \nbefore, that the net change in the mean flow can become significant if you wait long \nenough, even if the waves are of small amplitude – small but finite amplitude – so they are \nstill breaking.  So you’ve got this cumulative... [cumulatively-changed] mean flow.  And of \ncourse that in turn can refract the waves, and you get interesting interactions, an interplay \nbetween the waves and the mean flow. \n \nAnd the GLM theory... okay, now here comes a technical difficulty.  Breaking waves are \nincredibly complicated fluid motions.  They’re turbulent fluid motions in one sense or \nanother.  And this means that we don’t have an accurate theory to describe the details.  The \nbest you can hope to do is a computer simulation.  And computers, even today, are not \npowerful enough to simulate motions like that accurately.  So it’s really important to be able \nto say something about the problem independently of those details.  And GLM allows you to \nsay the following thing, that when the waves... think of the layer where the waves are \nbreaking.  Beneath that layer, the waves are not breaking, and indeed the linear wave theory \nis a good first approximation to understanding the rate at which momentum is being fed into \nthe wave-breaking layer.  So that tells you the... at least the average rate at which the air is \naccelerating in that layer. \n \nSo the theory tells you, you can compute that quite independently of the wave-breaking \ndetails.  That’s an important insight.  And most of our practical, you know, computer codes \nthat try and put this into weather forecasting models make assumptions of that sort.  They \nuse a linear wave theory, then they say they [the waves] break at a certain level, and there, in \nsome... there’s some... range of altitudes there, where the waves are breaking, where the \nmean flow feels an accelerating force. \n \nBy the way, that’s not the end of the story, because if you don’t have such a simplified \nexperiment, and you have a more realistic three-dimensional situation, there are very subtle \nextra effects.  We call them ‘remote recoil’ effects, and note, they were only recently \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n122 \nunderstood.  They’re in Oliver Bühler’s book, though, if anyone’s interested [laughs].  Um... \nbut, gosh, they’re really quite hard to describe in a few words.  So that’s one example. \n \n[31:55] \n \nLet me tell you another example where this... all this was important.  And actually David \nAndrews and I were working on this at the same time as developing the generalised [GLM] \nframework.  And that’s something that’s called the quasi-biennial oscillation of the zonal \nwinds in the equatorial stratosphere.  QBO for short.  And that’s another great bit of science.  \nIt was... gosh, I think it’s a great story.  Why don’t I try and tell it in a nutshell? \n \nYes.  I wonder... but just before you do, would you be able to say why it is at this time... you \nare... working in this... you’re looking at the stratosphere?  Why did you not... why are you \nnot looking at, you know, this part of the... this other part of the atmosphere, or looking at \nthis or working... looking at the oceans.  Why is it that at this point in your career, which, I \nsuppose we’re now talking – we’re in the ’70s – why is it the stratosphere that you are \nlooking at? \n \nWell, the short answer is scientific opportunism.  Scientists who do anything significant have \nto be opportunistic, because most problems are much too hard to solve.  This is why the \npolitical–bureaucratic imperative, to dictate to scientists what they should work on, doesn’t \nwork, usually – because what the politicians would like us to solve is usually too difficult to \nsolve.  But what really happens is incremental progress, where you spot something where \nyou can make progress.  That’s opportunism. \n \nWell, this QBO thing was a good example.  And I wasn’t the only one involved, because quite \na lot of progress had already been made.  But it was one of the great problems of the time, \nand I was aware that theories of wave mean flow interaction, of which GLM is... was an \nexample, did have something to say about that sort of problem.  So there it was.  In fact, as I \nsay, we were actually working on that, already, during David’s thesis.  And I suppose if you’d \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n123 \nasked me at the time I’d have said, well, one of the points of developing GLM is to get a \nbetter way of doing the theory of the QBO.  And now, shall I take a few minutes to \ndescribe... ? \n \nYes.  This is the quasi-biennial oscillation of the... \n \nzonal winds in the equatorial stratosphere.  Zonal means east or... eastward or westward.  \nAnd it’s a bit like that other picture I was showing about zonal winds in the stratosphere that \naren’t at the equator.  But the thing about the equator – this is the same point that came up \nwith this little thought-experiment of pushing from the western edge of the Pacific, \nremember, and sending an undercurrent across the Pacific – the equator is dynamically \nspecial because the Coriolis parameter vanishes, the vertical component of the Earth’s \nrotation vector [multiplied by 2, to be technically correct].  Or to put it another way, the Coriolis \neffect changes sign when you go across the equator. \n \nNow one of the outcomes of this is that flow in some band around the equator – in practice \nthis is a, you know, ten or fifteen... plus or minus ten or fifteen degrees of latitude  – that \nflow is a bit like flow in a channel.  And if you have a second-order wave-induced \nacceleration of the kind I’ve been talking about, you can actually accelerate that, so that it \nfirst... so that it goes, you know, more toward the west, or more toward the east, or \nwhatever. \n \nAnd now comes the really interesting thing.  By the way, I’m jumping ahead in the story, but \nlet me just continue this point.  We now know – we have very high confidence, I should say – \nthat the QBO is a wave-driven mean flow.  What we observe is that it goes first toward the \nwest, and then toward the east, and it takes about thirteen months for the flow to reverse.  \nAnd there’s a certain pattern in which it reverses earlier at higher altitudes.  It’s quite \ncharacteristic. \n \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n124 \nAnd, well, the end of the scientific story is, there is only one credible explanation for this.  \nAnd that is second-order wave-induced mean effects.  And the waves involved... there’s still \nsome uncertainty about exactly which set of waves are involved, but we’re pretty confident \nthat some of them [especially what are called ‘equatorial Kelvin waves’] are definitely involved.  \nAnd then there’s a bit of a grey area, because we don’t have good enough observations to \npin down all the waves.  Some of these waves are gravity-wave-like things, they’ve relatively \nhigh frequencies.  It’s rather expensive to observe them in detail.  Progress is being made on \nthis.  I mean, in ten years’ time, somebody might be able to get up and say, oh yes, we do \nknow all the main waves involved in driving the QBO. \n \nBut what happens in all these... so we’ve got various theoretical models of various sets of \nwaves.  But what’s common to all of them is the following two ingredients.  One is the wave-\ninduced cumulative mean-flow changes due to wave dissipation that I’ve been talking about.  \nThe other ingredient is refraction of the waves by the shear in the mean flow.  ’Cause I told \nyou it reversed earlier at higher altitudes; so there’s always some vertical shear.  So a wave \nthat’s going up from the, you know, massive lower atmosphere, generated by \nthunderstorms or whatever it might be, those waves are going to get refracted by the \nvertical shear.  And you can make a pretty good... a pretty convincing model of the QBO, if \nyou simplify and say, oh, there’s just two sets of waves, one of them propagating eastward \nand the other one propagating westward, that go up and get refracted. \n \nNow remember, when the waves dissipate, there’s a completely general tendency for the \ninduced acceleration to be in the same direction as the wave phase speed.  So the \nwestward-propagating waves will try and make the mean flow go westward, and vice versa.  \nAnd that’s actually one of the things we know is generally true from things like GLM theory.  \nSo now, take my two waves.  What happens is that... suppose the flow is going one way, it \nmakes it easier for the wave that happens to be going the opposite way to penetrate higher.  \nBut sooner or later, it’s going to break or otherwise dissipate.  There’s a... other dissipation \nmechanisms like infrared damping; let’s not get too technical.  The wave dissipates \nsomehow, and it does so high up, and begins to accelerate the mean flow in its own \ndirection. \n \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n125 \nSo if it’s an eastward-propagating wave... [unintelligible: “penetrating highest, in a flow initially \ngoing westward,” I should have said], the flow goes more and more toward the east, higher up.  \nAnd then you can see that there’s a shear layer... there’s a vertical shear... it’s still going \ntoward the west lower down.  And the wave keeps on breaking, and it... because it’s tending \ntoward critical-layer conditions...  You see, it doesn’t actually matter whether you actually \nhave a critical layer [critical level, I should have said], or not, it’s just toward critical-layer \nconditions that makes it more likely for the waves to break – like my ocean [beach] surf zone.  \nYou don’t have to be right at the edge, you see. \n \nIf the waves are breaking, the eastward acceleration takes place at lower and lower \naltitudes, and... until the eastward-moving winds get all the way down to the bottom of the \nstratosphere.  And at about that point, the westward-propagating wave suddenly realises \nthat it can penetrate high – because remember, the wave penetrates higher when the mean \nflow is going in the opposite direction to the wave phase speed.  It’s far from critical-layer \nconditions, if you like.  So now the westward wave does the same trick.  It starts accelerating \nthe high flow in the westward direction, and the whole cycle repeats itself in the same \nmanner.  So the wind keeps on reversing back and forth.  How fast it does depends on [is \nroughly proportional to] the square of the wave amplitude, okay. \n \nSo using your theory you were able to explain why it does this reversal... \n \nYeah... by the way, I mustn’t give the impression, that’s my theory.  I haven’t told you the \nearly scientific story.  There was a theory that said that, already on the books.  David \nAndrews and I were really refining that theory, and trying to put it on a firmer theoretical \nbasis, using GLM.  There was a technical issue about the particular waves involved, and at \nthe time people thought it was mainly two sorts of waves that are trapped in the tropical \nregions.  Let me be technical for a moment.  One is called an equatorial Kelvin wave, and the \nother is called an equatorial Rossby–gravity wave because it has a sort of... it shares... it’s... \nwell, let me try and be accurate.  It’s a single mode, but as the wavenumber and frequency \nvary, it can variously take on the character of being more like a Rossby wave, or more like a \ngravity wave.  So we call it “Rossby-hyphen-gravity wave”.  And that was thought to be the \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n126 \nother main wave, the westward-propagating one [though we now know that that’s an \noversimplification].  And so the first theory of the QBO – sorry, no, there was an earlier theory \nwhich just supposed they were gravity waves – but the one that really took hold was the one \nwhere you had the Rossby–gravity wave and the Kelvin wave, because they’d been \nobserved, you see.  That was really connecting the theory with things that had been \nobserved. \n \nYes, that was my question.  How had these QBOs, the... sorry... \n \nQBO is the mean flow, reversing mean flow. \n \nYes.  How had these reversals every thirteen months been seen?  You know, how did we \nknow... ?   \n \nOh, how were they observed? \n \nMm. \n \nOh, that’s a good question.  You know, I’ll come back to that when I tell you the whole \nscientific story.  I’m going to fast-wind backwards, and say how this was discovered.  But just \nto finish the theoretical point... okay, I’m just trying to say, I didn’t think of this first.  I can’t \nclaim credit for that.  But what I can claim credit is that the GLM theory and its... various \nspinoffs from that, which include this transformed-Eulerian-mean business – never mind the \ntechnicalities – but they gave you a better handle on how these peculiar equatorially-\ntrapped waves really worked. \nIt was quite hard to work out the details.  It was one of these problems where doing it from \nthe GLM point of view simplified the calculation, whereas the Eulerian was rather \ncumbersome [though the transformed Eulerian mean was also helpful]  and that had been done \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n127 \n[attempted, I should have said] by other people, before, but, you know, masses and ma... \nwhole pages of equations, and nobody understood it really [laughs].  [And there were some \ndetails in the literature that were actually wrong.] \n \n[0:42:11] \n \nSo now... okay, so that’s the technical side.  But the scientific history went like this, that after \nthe Second World War, as I said before, we had this network of upper-air observations, and \nthis was extended into the tropics.  I think it was related to bomb testing, or it became \nrelated to bomb testing, ’cause it was important to understand what was going on in the \ntropical stratosphere if you put nuclear mushroom clouds up there.  But, in one way or \nanother, we had radiosonde stations in the deep tropics, on various islands. \n \nAnd before that, even, there had been a few observations in the tropics.  One of them was \nby a German meteorologist called Berson.  I believe that was the late nineteenth century.  \nHere my history’s getting a bit wonky.  But Berson observed the flow in the tropical \nstratosphere to be what we call westerly, which means eastward [usually].  Terrible confusion \nin the terminology [laughs].  [I have long urged my colleagues to ban the terms ‘westerly’ and \n‘easterly’ as gratuitously confusing – after all, we never say ‘downerly’ to mean ‘upward’.]   I’ll call \nthem eastward for clarity, but they’re called the Berson Westerlies [laughs].  And then when \nKrakatoa blew its top in 1883, lots of people observed that the flow wasn’t... it was in the \nother direction [laughs].  So those were called the Krakatoa Easterlies – which, remember, \nmeans westward – but that was very conspicuous from the volcanic debris.  So for a long \ntime it was in the textbooks that there were the Berson Westerlies, and the Krakatoa \nEasterlies lying above them; and [that] that was the flow in the equatorial stratosphere. \n \nBut now, after the Second World War, upper-air observations became routine, rather than \njust special expeditions now and again.  And they quickly discovered... this was the early \n‘50s... a man at Seattle called Dick Reed, whom I [later] knew personally – a great guy, Dick, a \ngreat observational meteorologist and thinker – Dick Reed with two ‘e’s, R-e-e-d.   And \nanother man called Veryard, who I think was at the UK Met Office.  I never met him.  So \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n128 \nthis... the work of Reed and Veryard was the first to notice that this flow is time-dependent – \nthat it was toward the west, part of the time, and toward the east, e.g. thirteen-months-ish \nlater. \n \nAnd so of course then attention focused on this, and they said, ah, we’ve discovered a new \n‘biennial oscillation’, you see, because obviously  [they seem to have thought]  this is going to \nbe synchronised with the annual cycle.  But then the observations went on for a number of \nyears, and they realised it wasn’t synchronising with the annual cycle.  And then it became \ncalled the quasi-biennial [laughs] cycle.  And that’s what it’s called today – quasi-biennial \noscillation  rather – QBO.  So... in a way the rest... observationally, the rest is history.  You \ncan download a picture showing the wind reversing again and again and again, around every \nthirteen months.  The oscillation is not completely regular, but it’s one of the most nearly-\nregular, orderly things to emerge out of the chaos of atmospheric dynamics – which is \nalways an interesting dynamical-systems [i.e. ‘chaos theory’] point.  It’s one of the most \npredictable... it is actually the most predictable thing in the atmosphere [on such long \ntimescales], aside from the seasonal cycle – predictable by simply extrapolating ahead.   \n \n[0:45:36] \n \nOkay, so there there was this observed fact.  And when I was a postdoc at MIT under Jule \nCharney and Norman Phillips this was a great... let me get this right though... yes it was... \nthat was 1967.  Yes, it was still a great enigma.  That was a great enigma; \nthe apparent negative viscosity in the upper troposphere was [another] great enigma – I spoke \nof that before.  And by the way, the QBO is an example of negative viscosity, if you like.  \nYou’re driving the system away from solid rotation somehow.  It’s the opposite effect from \nordinary viscosity.  Okay, so there it was, this mystery, how did this happen? \n \n[0:46:23] \n \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n129 \nNow the next important thing in the history is something that’s seldom mentioned.  I think \nit’s important, because it’s like the Michelson–Morley experiment.  Some colleagues of mine \nat Seattle, where Dick Reed worked, were very interested in this.  And their names are Jim \nHolton and Mike Wallace.  Jim sadly died a few years ago –  a heart attack.  Mike Wallace is \nstill around.  They’re two of the great names in our subject – just as Seattle is one of the \ngreat research centres in our subject – the University of Washington at Seattle.  So [back in \n1968] Mike Wallace and Jim Holton published a paper in which they ran a simple numerical \nmodel to see if they could understand these wind reversals.  And they concluded, in the \npaper, that it [the QBO phenomenon] was incomprehensible.  [The paper said:] “we’ve put in all \nthe effects we know about, including eddy effects, such as were known” – they weren’t \nknown very well observationally – “and we couldn’t get the sort of momentum transport \nthat would account for these wind reversals.”  So the result of this paper is negative.  It was \njust like Michelson and Morley failing to find the aether wind [in the late 19th century].  And I \nalways mention this because our bureaucrats and paymasters are always telling us, you can’t \npublish negative results.   All scientists must discover positive results all the time.  [What’s \nmore, you must now tell your bureaucrats what the results are going to be, before you get them: \nthat’s called specifying the ‘deliverables’.]  My reply is, no, negative results can be \noverwhelmingly important.  And this is a good example. \n \nSo... in fact, they [Wallace and Holton] said a little more in this paper.  They said, you can \nexplain it only if you assume there’s a mysterious force that somehow mysteriously \ndescends, in time, to follow the pattern of the changing winds [and changing wind-shear].  But \nthey had no clue what this force could be.  Then another colleague called Dick Lindzen, \nwho’s another famous name – he’d been reading the Booker and Bretherton paper, the \nBretherton critical-layer work that I’d mentioned before, it was by Bretherton and a postdoc, \nI think, called Booker; and Dick was very interested in wave theory – and he immediately \nsaw that these sort of critical-layer-type effects in mean flows generated by waves, they \ncould... give you exactly this mysterious descending force.  Because they would tend to go \nwith the wind shear, you see. \n \nAnd the rest is history, because Holton and Lindzen published a paper on... saying that [that \nthe descending force could come from the wave-shear interactions] although, at first, with a too-\nsimpl... simplistic a model of the waves.  And then they published another paper with the \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n130 \ntwo waves I talked about, the Rossby–gravity wave and the Kelvin wave, which, you know, \nwe knew were there observationally.  So that was a big step forward.  And they got a \nreasonable simulation of the QBO, and... for the reasons that I’ve explained. \n \nBut I guess I’m trying to say it this way because it seems to me that being able to discover \nthat [the explanation from wave–mean interaction] did depend on the Michelson–Morley stage, \nwhere they were stuck, you know.  There were other attempts, by the way, to explain the \nQBO.  Bob Dickinson published a paper trying to explain it without waves, and failed again, \nyou see.  So there it is.  So by the time I came along, it was widely accepted that waves were \ninvolved, and that the sort of theory I’m talking about would be pertinent.  So we [David \nAndrews and I]  took that to a further stage of theoretical sophistication, which is a relatively \nmodest thing to do, but I think quite significant at the time [and advancing our understanding of \na far wider range of problems, I could have added]. \n \n[0:49:51] \n \nAnd at this time, are you working to any extent at home? \n \nWell, I’ve always tried to work partly at home and partly in the office, because I’ve, as I’ve \ntold you, been a bit of a loner and a maverick, and I like solitude and the chance to think \ndeeply.  And getting away from the hurly-burly... it’s important to be able to do that.  So I’ve \nalways, you know, done that, sometimes to the great annoyance of the wife and family.  \nOccasionally one gets away to libraries, as I said yesterday [laughs].  Being a theoretician \nyou’ve got your pencil and paper, and that’s about it, for a lot of the time. \n \nDid you have in your house in Cambridge a room where you could work, in other words \nwhere you could escape from the hurly-burly of family life without leaving the house? \n \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n131 \nYes, I’ve always tried to have a study at home.  I think most academics – serious scholars – \nhave that sort of arrangement.  Some of them take over the whole house, you know.  Karl \nPopper has... you know, bookshelves everywhere.  I’m not allowed to do that.  I mean, this is \nfair really.  I mean, we have to share the house with the family. \n \nAnd when we moved to Cambridge, we had a little house in De Freville Avenue, a little semi-\ndetached thing, and for a while I had my study up in the attic.  I actually improvised a sort of \nlittle cubbyhole in the attic where I sat and did things.  It wasn’t very good, though, because \nyou couldn’t pace around, and being able to pace around is important.  Later on I had a little \nstudy on the second floor, quite a small room but better than the attic cubbyhole.  And since \nwe moved from there to this house in Windsor Road, which is a bigger house, I’ve had quite \na lot of room for my studies –  ’f course I tend to abuse it ’cause I tend to fill it up with junk, \nlike this office! \n \nI’m in the middle of trying to clear it out now, because now I’ve got most significant things \non the computer.  You see, when I started there was no alternative but having paper.  If I \nwere starting now, I would realise the danger and get things on to the computer as fast as I \ncould.  Do you know that little article, The Social Life of Paper by Malcolm Gladwell – came \nout in the New Yorker – talking about most creative workers needing to play around with \nthings on paper.  Unless you’re like Mozart and have an eidetic memory, then you can do the \nsame thing in your head, which is very convenient.  But most of us have to fiddle around on \npaper.  There’s this wondrous cartoon of this guy scratching his head with piles of paper \neverywhere.  I’ll show it to you later.  So that’s the way I’ve always had to work, ’cause my \nmemory has always been capricious.   \n \nWhen did you move to the Windsor Road house? \n \n’79, sometime around the end of our professional musical career, apart from the memorial \nconcert for David Crighton [in 2001] .  I told you about David Crighton , our visionary Head of \nDepartment.  I think he had an eidetic memory.  He was a walking encyclopaedia of who’s \nMichael McIntyre C1379-72 \nTrack 4 \n \n132 \nwho in applied mathematics, and... I remember him coming to talk to me and, you know, he \nwanted to learn something in... my community that I knew about.  And he asked me the \nquestions and listened carefully.  I feel it was like talking to this tape recorder.  He listened \ncarefully, and at the end said thank you and went away.  I think he remembered every word.  \nAnd he showed he knew this stuff, because he made all sorts of brilliant new appointments \nin the Department, and was a visionary leader as well, the sort of guy who, you know, \nencourages everyone to give their best.  He was a great man.  And a brilliant applied \nmathematician.  He did wonderful work on aeroacoustics and shockwaves and things like \nthat. \n \n[0:53:38] \n \nSo after... QBO... in the stratosphere... \n \nOkay, so we got several papers out of that.  We had a couple of papers on the QBO and the \nwave structures, that they were, you know, this Rossby–gravity and Kelvin wave, and the \nmean effects [of those waves], and... the transformed Eulerian mean.  And also the GLM \ntheory.  That was a couple more papers that came out later, because that was technically \ntougher, so we took longer to write those papers. \n \nAnd where does that take us to, time-wise... ? \n \nWell, those two papers were ’78, weren’t they?  So let’s see.  I’m going to have to look at my \nCV to remember what happened next. \n \n[End of Track 4] \nMichael McIntyre Page 133 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n133 \nTrack 5 \n \nCould you describe continuing work on the stratosphere? \n \nOkay.  Well, as I remember, I became gradually more and more interested in the \nstratosphere through a sort of accumulation of effects.  Okay, I’d been interested in the \nQBO, and that was enough to get me to a number of conferences on the stratosphere, to \nreport that work.  And so I naturally heard about other stratospheric concerns. \n \nOne of the big hot topics was something called the stratospheric sudden warming.  This had \nbeen discovered by observers at the Free University of Berlin some time before, just from \nballoon-borne soundings [radiosondes], where you suddenly saw the temperature [at high \nlatitudes and] at stratospheric altitudes – probably twenty-five to thirty kilometres – suddenly \nrise, over a day or two, by many degrees Celsius.  And this was remarkable because it was \nknown that the timescales for temperatures to change purely by solar heating, and infrared \nradiative cooling to space, were slower – quite a lot slower.  So it was obvious straight away \nto everyone that dynamics was involved, but nobody had a clue about what sort of \ndynamics, fluid dynamics I mean.  So there was quite a big community interested in these \nresults from Berlin, and [from] other observers. \n \nAnd one of the landmark papers on this was published before I got involved.  It was by a \nwonderful man who’s now, you know, a very eminent senior person in the Japanese \nmeteorological community.  His name was Taroh Matsuno.  I [now] know him very well \npersonally.  He’s a lovely man and a great scientist.  And in 1970-ish he published a pair of \npapers, one of which showed what looked like a remark ably realistic simulation of a \nstratospheric sudden warming.  And what happens is that, in the winter stratosphere, \nthere’s a spinning mass of air called the polar-night vortex.  And we sometimes call it the \npolar night jet, because the velocity profile tends to be concentrated around the edge at, \nyou know, something like sixty north on average.  And, in a sudden warming, what happens \nMichael McIntyre Page 134 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n134 \nis that this vortex either gets enormously displaced off the pole, and partly or completely \ndestroyed, or it splits into two parts. \n \nNow Matsuno made a spectacular simulation of the second sort where it splits into two – \nlike an amoeba splitting.  And he did this with a theory that was at first sight far too simple \nto be able to do this because, although these were very large-amplitude motions, he used \nwhat was [and is] called the linear theory of Rossby waves, in which you pretend that the \nflow in the stratosphere consists of a mean flow round and round latitude circles – if you \nwill, a polar vortex that’s undisturbed – and then you disturb it a little bit, with a small-\namplitude, large-scale wave.  These waves are called Rossby waves, and if we have time we \ncan talk a bit about their dynamics, although it’s a standard and well known thing.  But these \nRossby waves distort the vortex, and if you have a Rossby wave that has a zonal \nwavenumber two – that means there are two wavelengths around each latitude circle – and \nif it reaches large amplitudes, then the vortex can split into two in the way I described, like \nan amoeba.  So you can think of it as a very-large-amplitude, wave-two Rossby wave. \n \nNow Matsuno’s theory shouldn’t really have succeeded in simulating that kind of thing, \nbecause it was a linearised theory [therefore strictly valid for small amplitude only]; but he did \ndo one thing [beyond standard linearised theory], which is let the mean flow change in \nresponse to the waves.  So this theory had built into it the sort of wave–mean interaction \nthat I’d been studying in these other problems I’ve talked about.  So, when the waves \nreached large amplitude, the mean flow changed.  And the net effect, when you added the \nchanged mean flow and the waves together, was this astonishingly realistic pattern that \nlooked rather like a real stratospheric warming of wavenumber two. \n \nAnd so that of course got everyone, including me, excited and interested and [we] wondered \nhow such a trick could be done because, really, waves of such large amplitude should not be \ndescribable by linear theory.  And, well, I’d already thought a bit about nonlinear wave \neffects of other sorts.  Well, indeed, they were known in other contexts.  Nonlinear, meaning \nthat you can’t assume the wave amplitude is small any more.  You’ve got to take the second-\norder corrections, and perhaps higher corrections, and put them all together, to get a true \nMichael McIntyre Page 135 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n135 \npicture of the fluid motion.  So there we were.  We [the research community] had a theory that \nworked better than it should have, and I was curious how this could be. \n \n[0:05:38] \n \nNow around the same time, and here I’m not quite sure of the chronology...  Well, of course, \nthe other thing in the background, I should say, is that there was growing concern about the \nozone layer.  In the mid-1970s, if I recall, there was a concern that the ozone layer might be \naffected by supersonic aircraft exhausts, so there was a programme of, uh, chemical \nresearch initiated, that began to look into this.  Our American colleagues were involved; the \nUK Met Office was involved.  And the atmospheric chemists were beginning on this long \nroad of understanding the rather great complexities of atmospheric chemistry: how all the \ntrace constituents and nitric oxides and so on might affect ozone.  And of course it was well \nknown that the ozone layer protected us from solar ultraviolet.  And so clearly it was \nimportant to understand if it would hang together or not. \n \nAnd then there was the work of Molina and Rowland [two of the chemists]; they... who \npointed out that it mightn’t just be nitric oxides.  It might also be chlorine radicals coming \nfrom man-made chlorofluorocarbons [CFCs] that, when they get into the stratosphere, are \nbroken up by the hard solar ultraviolet – that they might have an effect on ozone depletion \nas well, or perhaps more [than the nitric oxides].  And as I recall it, the point they made was \nthat you could have catalytic action. \n \nThe CFCs, especially back then, were present in the atmosphere in very small amounts, \nmeasured in parts per trillion.  A decade later they were getting into the, you know, one or \ntwo hundred parts per trillion, as I recall.  And of course the professional disinformers – \nwhose business was to try and discredit any science about this, because it might affect the \nchemical industry – they were arguing [for instance], oh, how can such tiny amounts of \nchlorofluorocarbons possibly affect the ozone layer in this vast sky above us. \nMichael McIntyre Page 136 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n136 \n \nAnd the reply, first articulated by Molina and Rowland, I believe, was, look, you can have \ncatalytic action.  That means that one chlorine atom can destroy many ozone molecules, \n’cause it gets recycled again and again.  And...  so, anyway... but it was many years until that \nwas resolved, by the discovery of the ozone hole and the recognition of new sorts of \nchemical reactions, which turned out to be more efficient at depleting ozone catalytically.  \nBut fundamentally it was just that kind of thing. \n \nAnd I was very much involved in the work to understand how the whole jigsaw fitted \ntogether: the fluid dynamics, the sudden warmings, the chemistry, and the radiation.  It was \nan interdisciplinary collaborative effort, the outcome of which was a pretty good \nunderstanding of how the ozone hole formed – and how it was caused by man-made \n[chloro]fluorocarbons [mostly].  And the depth of that understanding and the crosschecks – \nhow it all fitted together and was checked by observations, including some famous airborne \nexpeditions one of which I went on myself – the outcome was a level of scientific confidence \nsufficiently high that the disinformers went quiet.  [Or so I thought; see ‘Tobacco Smoke’ on page \n171 below.] \n \nThey turned their attention to the climate problem, and today they’re working hard to \ndiscredit  climate  science.  But they went quiet on ozone because the evidence became too \noverwhelming  [and possibly also because the short-term financial stakes seemed lower].  And, as a \nresult, we have the Montreal Protocol and the... prohibition... the... capping of emissions of \nthe chlorine-[containing] and other halogen-containing chemicals that are dangerous for the \nozone layer.  And a by-product of that, by the way, is that the climate greenhouse effect is \nnow less severe than it would otherwise have been.  But that was just... that’s just a lucky \nspinoff, so...  I’m getting ahead of myself, aren’t I, because my role in this was to understand \nthe fluid dynamics better.   \n \n[0:10:04] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 137 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n137 \nAnd... it sort of grew out of my theoretical interest in wave–mean interaction, because these \npapers of Matsuno seemed to capture some aspects of the sudden warming phenomenon, \nusing a rather simplistic wave–mean interaction model.  But I was curious as to – you know, \nhow could we understand that better.  Now it was already clear that the large-scale wave \nmotions involved in the sudden warmings were what we call planetary-scale Rossby waves.  \nAnd they’re... something that, you know, is standard knowledge these days, how they work; \nbut it’s quite tricky to explain how, at a layman’s level. \n \nBut let’s try and say it this way.  You’ve got motions with timescales of a few days, of large \nscale, in a stratified, rotating fluid.   And it turns out that the dynamically important aspects \nof that motion all turn on the distributions of something called potential vorticity.  And this \ngoes back to some work of Carl-Gustaf Rossby in the 1930s, and it was added to by a \nGerman theoretician called Hans Ertel.  Actually Rossby had most of it, but let me not get \ninto an argument about the history of understanding potential vorticity [which goes back all \nthe way back to the 19th century, especially to Lord Kelvin’s discovery of the circulation theorem \nalready mentioned.] \n \nHow can we say what it is [the potential vorticity]?  It’s a measure of the horizontal rotation of \nthe fluid.  Remember that it’s all stably stratified.  You have heavy fluid under light; you have \nvertical density gradients.  The fluid likes to move nearly horizontally in layers.  And so the \ndynamically important things on these timescales are horizontal motions along stratification \nsurfaces that carry the, as it were, rotational information.  That includes the information \nabout the Earth’s rotation as well.  And it turns out that you can capture almost everything \nabout the dynamics by constructing this thing called potential vorticity. \n \nAnd one way to think of it – which actually Rossby very clearly described [in a paper published \nin 1938] – is to think of a small chain of fluid particles [a small material contour]; here we go \nwith the Lagrangian description of fluid motion again.  You fix attention on a little closed \nloop of fluid particles lying in one of the stable-stratification surfaces.  So it would be \nhorizontal if there were no disturbance.  And around this loop, there’s something that we \ncall the Kelvin circulation.  It’s a kind of average of the part of the velocity field that goes \nMichael McIntyre Page 138 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n138 \nround and round this loop.  [By ‘part’ I meant what’s technically called the vector ‘component’ \npointing along the loop, at any point on the loop.]  So for instance, if this loop were in the middle \nof a strong vortex, it would have a nonzero value of this [Kelvin] circulation, simply ’cause the \nflow is going round and round the loop.  And again, if you have a jet, for example – a shear \nflow – and you put your little contour [the loop] on one side of it, then you get a nonzero \nvalue of this circulation thing because, on the side of the circuit [the loop] nearest the jet, you \nget a bigger contribution to adding up all these contributions from the velocity directed \naround this loop.  Technically this is called a line integral, the line integral of  u.ds,  where  ds  \nis an arc element along the loop.   [And u is the velocity field relative to the stars, i.e. including the \nEarth’s rotation.  The Kelvin circulation can be defined for any loop, large or small, including the \nundulating ‘wiggly line’, the material contour already mentioned in connection with the GLM theory.] \n \nNow this Kelvin circulation...  If you think of the circulation around a small loop – where \nsmall means smaller than any of the significant scales of motion – that’s [that’s the potential \nvorticity] up to a, you know, normalising constant, a multiplicative constant.  You can choose \nthat depending on what units you want to measure it in.  Apart from that kind of thing, that \nis what we mean by the potential vorticity. \n \n[For a clearer discussion, see my article Potential Vorticity, in press for the 2nd edition of the \nEncyclopedia of Atmospheric Sciences –  copy available, with permission, on my website.  And I forgot \nto emphasise the crucial point that, for non-dissipative or ideal-fluid motion, Kelvin’s circulation \ntheorem implies that the potential vorticity is a material invariant: it is constant following a fluid \nparticle.] \n \nNow... this potential vorticity, as I think I said before, contains all the dynamical information, \nto good approximation.  And there are a lot of nontrivial technicalities associated with that, \nbut roughly speaking, if it’s slow motion – on the sort of timescale, of several days, of these \nRossby waves – you capture almost all the dynamical information by looking at the \ndistributions of potential vorticity on each stratification surface in the stratosphere.   \n \n[0:14:35] \nMichael McIntyre Page 139 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n139 \n \nNow what is a Rossby wave?  A Rossby wave is a sideways motion that depends on having a \nlarge-scale gradient of potential vorticity.  So what you have in the real stratosphere is high \nvalues of potential vorticity at [or near] the pole, because that’s where the Earth’s rotation \nmakes the strongest contribution, to this [Kelvin] circulation thing.  Remember, the Earth’s \nrotation has to be counted, as well as the relative motion.  So the potential vorticity tends to \nbe highest near the pole, and lowest at the equator where the circuit’s at right angles to the \nEarth’s rotation; and it changes sign if you go into the southern hemisphere.  So there’s pole-\nto-equator-to-pole gradient of this thing.  And as soon as you’ve got a gradient of potential \nvorticity on each stratification surface, you have a new wave propagation mechanism.  \nThat’s what we call Rossby waves. \n \nAnd the way it works is roughly as follows.  If I think about an undisturbed stratosphere with \nthe flow just around latitude circles, in the sort of way we thought of before, and we \nrecognise that the potential vorticity is high on the poleward side and low on the \nequatorward side [with all the constant-potential-vorticity contours lying parallel to latitude circles], \nthen if I now disturb this a little bit, with a large-scale [non-dissipative] motion in which my \ncontour undulates, and bends toward the equator in one place [location], and toward the \npole in another, then [because of material invariance]  I’ve brought high potential vorticity \ntoward the equator in the first place [location], and low potential vorticity in the second.  So \nnow, along a latitude circle there’s a change [a variation in the values] of the potential \nvorticity: plus, minus, plus, minus...  For Matsuno’s wave two you’d have plus, minus, plus, \nminus, and then you’d be back to where you started. \n \nNow, as I said, the potential vorticity contains all the dynamical information.  So the moment \nI say I’ve got this distribution of potential vorticity, I can deduce – technically we call this \n‘potential vorticity inversion’; we say it’s ‘invertible’; we can do a mathematical operation \ncalled inversion and deduce the wind field – and when you do that with this particular case, \nyou find that the part of your contour that’s furthest southward – is displaced furthes’ \nsouthward – has zero velocity.  And on either side... if you go toward the northward-\ndisplaced part on the left [i.e. westward], you get a southward velocity.  And if you go toward \nMichael McIntyre Page 140 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n140 \nthe northward-displaced part of the contour on the right  [i.e. eastward], you get a northward \nvelocity.  And now what you have to do is make a movie in your head of what will happen to \nthat contour when it’s advected by that velocity field.  And, if you get the sign right, you can \nsee that the undulation will propagate toward the west.  Or to put it another way [and more \ngenerally], it propagates with the high potential vorticity on the right – okay? \n \nAnd straight away, to anyone educated in physics, this is absolutely weird.  Here is a wave \nthat can only go one way, you see.  It can only go ‘westward’ [meaning with high potential \nvorticity on its right].  All classical waves – sound waves, gravity waves, practically anything \nyou could think of – they can happily go either way.  There’s a mathematical reason, which is \nin the equations for the [classical] wave motion there are what we call two time derivatives.  \nWell, in this Rossby-wave theory, based on potential-vorticity invertibility, you have only one \ntime derivative, because it’s the one that tells you how things change when the potential \nvorticity is advected – is carried, is moved from place to place by the fluid motion.  So if you \nhave wave propagation it can only be one-way.  So straight away that’s interesting.  Of \ncourse there’s no mystery.  It’s not as if you’ve violated the basic time-reversibility of \nphysics.  I’m talking about dissipationless fluid motion.  It’s one-way only because it’s \nnoticing which way the Earth is rotating.  If I really reverse time, the Earth would have to \nrotate the other way, and the waves would go the other way, so that’s alright [laughs].  So \nthat’s a Rossby wave. \n \n[0:18:44] \n \nNow if you want to understand sudden warmings... now I’m going to jump.  I think I’m going \nto have to jump ahead.  I’ve already made the point that to begin to understand Rossby \nwaves the first thing you’ve got to do is look at the distributions of potential vorticity, PV we \nalways call it in the trade.  (‘Rossby–Ertel potential vorticity’ is a bit of a mouthful; I’m going \nto call it PV.)  And you need to look at the distribution of that on each stratification surface.  \nAnd at the time I began to get interested in this, it was thought... there was a conventional \nwisdom that said, you can’t do that, because the observational data aren’t good enough.  \nOne very eminent scientist was reputed to have gone round saying that “anyone who \nMichael McIntyre Page 141 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n141 \ncomputes  [from observational data] a quantity so highly differentiated as potential vorticity  is \na fool!” \n \nNevertheless, a colleague of mine at the Met Office, or some colleagues of mine – one of \nthem was Dr Tim Palmer, whom I’ve mentioned before – decided they were going to try and \ncompute it anyway.  That’s what Erasmus Darwin would have called a ‘damn-fool \nexperiment’.  Often it doesn’t work, but when it does it can be terrific. \n \nAnd this one was terrific, because what they got, from this attempt to compute the PV on \nstratification surfaces [during a stratospheric sudden warming],  was what we afterwards called \n‘a blurred view of reality seen through knobbly glass’.  And of course – fast-forwarding to \ntoday – now we have a very fine-scale view of the same thing, from the full might of \nweather-forecasting technology and four-dimensional data assimilation.  It’s a very high-tech \nsubject these days.  And now we can see the potential vorticity in the stratosphere in a lot of \ndetail.  And I have a movie of this that I tend to show in recent talks, ’cause for me it’s \nexciting to have seen this blurred view [long ago] and, afterwards [today], seen it in fine \ndetail.  [This movie is in slide 29 of my recent Haurwitz Lecture, available from a link on my home \npage.] \n \n[0:20:48] \n \nCan I just ask a couple of questions before you go on? \n \nPlease.  Sorry, I’m talking too much [laughs]. \n \nNo, no, no.  One is, how did you establish contacts at the Met Office?  What’s the origin of \nyour relationship with the Met Office, given that you... ?   \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 142 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n142 \nOh goodness.  Well, of course, being interested in atmospheric flows, I was naturally \ninterested in making contacts – at first for no special purpose.  In fact I remember once going \nthere [very early in my career], and being told by a redoubtable member of the weather-\nforecasting [team]... you know, they were just beginning to develop operational numerical \nweather forecasting then, and they were very practical people who were writing things in \nmachine code, and doing all the huge labour – beginning to try and think out how to \nassimilate the data – it was all a very... primitive in those days.  But I remember going there \nand trying to make friends with some of these people, and being told that my interest in \nwave mean flow interaction work... [that it] belonged to “cloud-cuckoo land” [laughs].  But... \nbeing a bit of a maverick, as you know, I sort of went – and being interested in it, and luckily \nhaving an academic position where I had intellectual freedom – I could get on... workin’ in \nmy cloud-cuckoo land anyway.  And it’s a perfect example of how curiosity-driven research \nlater has important scientific implications.  But that was... okay, that was my first contact \nwith the Met Office, by the way.  I had many others since then. \n \nYes. \n \nAnd this... the... y’know Tim Palmer and his colleagues, Sid Clough and others, they... in fact \nafter our... I wrote... I published a couple of papers with Palmer on the ‘blurred view of \nreality’ [in fact 3 papers in 1983,4,5]  and then Sid Clough, Alan O’Neill and... somebody else \ncalled Grahame... there was a [1985] paper by Clough, Grahame and O’Neill that followed \nthat up, with a better-quality analysis where they took more care.  They used data from two \nsatellites instead of one, and it was quite an impressive piece of work at the time.  So \ngradually this view got clearer.  And that was my contact with the Met Office then.  And I \nmust give Tim Palmer some credit for that, ’cause that arose because he – being an \nenterprising and very bright young man – decided he’d come up and talk to me about \nstratified rotating fluid dynamics [around 1980].  ’Cause he’d just got to the Met Office having \ndone a degree in general relatively with Roger Penrose; so he wanted to learn about the \nstuff I knew about, so that was the beginning of [or rather, precursor to] this rather fruitful \ncollaboration. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 143 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n143 \n[0:23:15] \n \nWhy would they... why would this individual at the Met Office – and I think you implied that \nthis was a more general view at the Met Office among those who were beginning to do \nnumerical weather forecasting – why would they have regarded work on generalised mean \nflow resulting in the interaction of waves as belonging to cloud cuckoo land?  What was it \nabout it that would have been seen by them as different from what they were interested in? \n \nYeah, okay.  I think I’m conflating two different periods.  The earlier period where I heard \nthis cloud-cuckoo-land remark – that was very early in my career – the later phase [about \n1980 onward] when Tim Palmer and others got in touch... \n \nOh yes, yes, I realise this is from the earlier period, well before you were working with Tim \nPalmer – but why then would it have been seen as not what they were interested in? \n \nWhy?  Well, they were, of course, focused on building these codes to do the numerical \nweather forecasting, you know, and getting the computers, the relatively primitive \ncomputers... it was a tough engineering job to get anywhere at all with that.  So I think they \nwere a bit impatient with young upstarts like me who came in talking about fancy fluid-\ndynamical concepts [laughs] – which I naturally did – having come from Cambridge with our \nfluid-dynamics group where we did this... you know, you heard about these things every \nFriday.  So there was a sort of communication gap there. \n \nAnd what was it necessary... in order to... with Tim Palmer, to produce these first maps of \npotential vorticity on each stratified layer, what was it necessary to measure, or to... what \ndata was it necessary to look at in order to produce them? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 144 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n144 \nWell, remarkably few data.  Actually, the fact that you can get away with small amounts of... \nwell, let me be more precise.  It’s mostly temperature data, because the main data source \nwas an infrared sensor on a satellite.  This was one of the earliest meteorological... y’know, \noperational infrared sensors.  I mean, various visionary people could see that observing the \natmosphere from space had a lot of potential.  I think some of this was pioneered at Oxford, \nwhere they...  But anyway, this satellite was an operational meteorological satellite.  I think it \nwas called TIROS.  And what that stands for I’ve long forgotten.  But they had these data \nfrom that satellite – they were essentially temperature fields in the stratosphere – and at \nfirst sight you’d think that that would be hopelessly inadequate, but the... for the same \nreason that the potential vorticity contains all the dynamical information, you can actually \nuse other datasets; and they contain much more dynamical information than you would \nthink at first. \n \nIt’s related to the nature of the slow motions – being very dominated by the Earth’s rotation \nand the Coriolis forces.  There’s a tendency for the Coriolis force to come into balance with \nthe pressure gradient.  So, you see, that relates the velocity field to the pressure field, and \ntherefore to the temperature field, because, also, hydrostatic balance in the vertical is a \ngood approximation.  So you can begin to see why you can get away with that small amount \nof information.  It’s called the ‘balance condition’; and that’s been another interest of mine.  \nIt can get quite technically intricate, trying to construct balance conditions as accurately as \npossible.  You can refine all this.  This is why potential-vorticity inversion actually works a lot \nbetter than it should.  In principle  [in practice, quite often, I should have said], it’s quite \naccurate. \n \n[0:26:53] \n \nAnd so could you then describe the actual business of practically working with Tim Palmer on \nthis?  In other words, did you meet up?  If you didn’t meet up, how did you work, and if you \ndid meet up what did you do when you were together? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 145 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n145 \nWell, I think what happened was something like the following.  I... a couple of years... no, \nabout a year before that [1982],  I’d published a big review article on stratospheric sudden \nwarmings.  You know, I think this was inspired, a lot of it, by Matsuno’s work.  I was intensely \ninterested.  So I somehow got invited to write this big review article, for a special issue of the \nJournal of the Meteorological Society of Japan.  And that was one thing where I, well, if you \nlike, got lucky.  You know, in the science game you get lucky, or not, with whether this or \nthat work is influential.  This was an influential paper.  (And in fact it was brought back in the \nJapan conference I was at – just the other month – where I gave a slightly nostalgic talk \nabout how things had developed since then.) \n \nSo this [the old review article] was published in 1982.  And it had a line in it that went \nsomething like, if only we could [see the actual PV distributions...] ...  You know, it was already \nclear to me that something...  it was... well, everybody knew that Rossby waves were \ninvolved, but I’d begun to realise that you really had to think of them as breaking waves.  \nAnd that... remember, I described a simple Rossby wave in terms of a contour of constant \npotential vorticity undulating northward or southward.  But now if you imagine the wave \ngetting to a large amplitude, you can imagine that contour deforming irreversibly – curling \naround – all in the horizontal. \n \nAnd it... especially because of the GLM theory, which already focused attention on material \ncontours, and, in a frictionless adiabatic motion – an ideal [i.e. dissipationless] fluid motion – a \npotential-vorticity contour on a stratification surface is a material contour.  So if that \ndeforms irreversibly, that’s an example of the conditions for significant wave–mean effects \nto occur, just like breaking ocean waves on an ocean beach.  Zoologically very different – \nmorphologically different – but fundamentally similar because in both cases you are \nirreversibly deforming these material contours.  And Tim Palmer and I actually ended up \nadvertising this as... as, it ought to be the fundamental way to define wave breaking, in a \nvery general way. \n \nBut anyway, in this [1982] review I sort of recognised this must be going on.  This was – I \nhave to acknowledge – with the help of somebody who’d been following up on Matsuno’s \nMichael McIntyre Page 146 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n146 \nwork in Seattle, my colleague Jim Holton.  I’ve mentioned him already in connection with the \nQBO.  He had a student called Flossie Hsu – Chi-ping Hsu – who was a very bright student.  \nShe did some simulations like Matsuno’s, but she started to look at how those simulations \ndescribe fluid particles moving around.  So I already had a reminder that material contours \ncould deform irreversibly.  So I was able to put that together conceptually with the wave–\nmean ideas and say, hey, look, we should really recognise this as a significant phenomenon – \nand call it ‘breaking Rossby waves’ – and recognise that the irreversible effects that you \nobserve in a sudden warming actually have to do with that. \n \nAnd just to inject a little bit of insight, the reason Matsuno’s work worked better than it \nshould, is that by following the wave and mean flow evolution together, it managed to \ncapture a bit of the dynamics of breaking waves.  It couldn’t possibly describe it correctly in \ndetail, but it captured enough of it to actually represent something of what was going on – \nwhich was a small miracle, in my view.   \n \n[0:30:48] \n \nWhat is the material boundary?  Is it between different levels of potential vorticity? \n \nOkay.  Remember this potential vorticity thing, this PV, it’s... in ideal fluid flow it’s a material \ninvariant.  It stays the same on a given piece of fluid – fluid particle if you will.  So if now you \nredo this thought-experiment with the – y’know, starting with the symmetric flow, \nsymmetric around latitude circles – and then undulate the contours, these contours are \ncontours of constant PV.  So they’re also material contours if the flow is ideal.  It’s only \napproximately true in the real stratosphere, but it’s not a bad approximation.  So you’ve got \nthese material contours. \n \nAnd, well, my review article talked about this quite a lot because I had to, sort of, imagine \nthis.  I had to have a, sort of, overheated imagination of this going on ’cause nobody had \nMichael McIntyre Page 147 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n147 \nseen it for real.  All I’d done was done some idealised models.  It’s called ‘Rossby-wave \ncritical layer theory’.  I’d picked up on some very interesting work of my colleagues, \nStewartson, Tom Warn and Helen Warn – Keith Stewartson, Tom Warn and Helen Warn – \nthey’d done this rather idealised problem [now called the SWW theory].  But I was interested \n[and had taken the SWW theory further, in collaboration with the late Peter  Killworth] because it \nwas the simplest way you could model mathematically, in a rather precise way, a situation \nwhere Rossby waves propagated from one place and broke in another. \n \nSo it was a kind of conceptual crutch for understanding the real stratosphere.  And that’s \nactually the only reason my name got on to the paper with Tim Palmer, you see, because \nPalmer and his colleagues had actually constructed the PV maps at the Met Office.  They had \nthe data and the resources to do it.  And the first idea was, well, we should publish a pair of \npapers together, in which I describe the theory – how the theory was telling us that what \nthey were seeing – this blurred view of reality – was probably real, in its gross features at \nleast.  But we ended up thinking, oh, it’s much more powerful to have a joint paper, in which \nyou pull all that discussion together in one paper.  And that was the right thing, because that \nwas an influential paper. \n \nAnd how far did you write it together, literally together, in the same room? \n \nWell, I think we did a lot of... well, we did some of it in the same room, but a lot of it was, \nyou know, passing drafts back and forth...  I think I did more of the writing myself, because I \nwas slightly more up to speed on the scientific background at that time.  If we did it now it \nwould probably be Tim, because he’s [now] a great luminary with enormous knowledge, \nacross practically everything about numerical [and real] weather behaviour. \n \nAnd could you tell the story of first seeing this blurred view of reality, including your personal \nreaction to it? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 148 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n148 \nOh gosh, that was very exciting, because what happened was I somehow had sight of this \nthing – I think Tim and I had been in touch.  Probably my review had... I think it probably \ninfluenced him… [Anyway, my memory of his showing me the PV maps for the first time is one of \nwild excitement – essentially recognizing, in a flash, what had previously existed only in my \noverheated imagination, with help from the SWW theory.] \n \nIt also [indirectly] influenced the group at Reading, who started using PV maps to describe, \nyou know, ordinary weather – cyclones and anticyclones.  That was another important, you \nknow, spinoff from the work.  [I should try to say that more carefully.  I think my review influenced \nTim, and then Tim’s and my work, in turn, influenced the Reading group , as described next:] \n \nThere’s another luminary in our field, Professor Brian Hoskins [at Reading, now Sir Brian] – he’s \na great scientist and he’d done all sorts of other important things – but he had a student \ncalled Andy Robertson, at Reading, and Andy got very excited when he saw the first draft of \nthe first McIntyre and Palmer paper.  And he... I think that’s what – or at least that’s what \nBrian told me – that he [Andy] was just switched on by, you know, the enthusiasm of our... \nbecause our paper was full of enthusiasm because we knew we’d made something of a \nbreakthrough with this.  And… y’know, we’d checked things carefully, we’d done trajectory \nstudies [material-particle paths – including some that I calculated by hand myself, from the \nobservational data], we’d… it wasn’t  just my theoretical work [following the SWW work] that \nreally helped make the case.  [And it added up to a strong defence against the charge of being \n“fools”!]  So there was Andy Robertson saying, hey, why don’t we do this... I think Brian had \nalready started him on something like this, but this made him take off and really go for it. \n \nSo as a result of that, he and I and Brian Hoskins [later] wrote a review paper, which was also \nvery influential – Hoskins, McIntyre and Robertson (1985) – in which we showed how \nlooking at isentropic distributions of PV helped you to understand how synoptic-scale \nweather systems work [cyclogenesis etc].  And by the way, I said before that these weather \nsystems don’t look wavelike at first sight.  They look like very nonlinear, turbulent... sort of \nlarge-scale turbulent things.   But actually wave motion is very much involved, and is \nsurprisingly like what happens in the stratosphere.  That was another big surprise.  And it \nMichael McIntyre Page 149 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n149 \nfirst came out [a few years earlier] in another paper that I wrote with Brian Hoskins and a guy \ncalled Harry Edmon, who was at Seattle, in Jim Holton’s group, and Harry... or it might have \nbeen Mike Wallace’s group, I think.  But they had the observational data, and we were able \nto show how this wave–mean interaction theory could be brought into touch with \nobservational data in a new way, by constructing something called ‘Eliassen–Palm cross-\nsections’.  There’s a terrible bit of jargon for you.  But that’s actually now a standard tool \nthat people use.  [It’s intimately related to the transformed Eulerian mean.] \n \n[0:36:09] \n \nAnd how did this dynamical structure in the stratosphere at the different levels and the \nbreaking of the distinctions between them – how did that affect weather in the... how did it \nrelate to weather?  How was this useful for someone at the Met Office, and for someone in \nthe Meteorology Department at Reading? \n \nWell, it’s funny you should mention that, because that today is a very hot topic: how do \nthings in the middle stratosphere, like sudden warmings, affect weather down below?  And \nclimate trends, and everything else?  And that question has still not been answered very \nclearly, although there now seems to be no doubt that there is an influence [downward from \nthe stratosphere].  And that’s a relatively recent thing that depends on, you know, our far, you \nknow, finer view we get from assimilated data.  We have a much more accurate picture of \nhow the atmosphere has evolved over several decades, because these, you know, weather \nforecasting systems that I talk about – data assimilation and so forth – they’ve been re-run \nover many decades using the best data they can get, and the best models and data \nassimilation they can get.  It’s called the Reanalysis Project.  So now there are long records of \nthe best that our technology can say happened in the atmosphere, and you can see things \nthat look like climate-change trends in these datasets [though of course there are serious issues \nabout long-term calibration of the observing systems].  And you can see signs of the stratosphere \ninfluencing the troposphere. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 150 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n150 \nNow let me just backtrack a moment.  When I began to work on this, the standard paradigm \nwas: the stratosphere is relatively less dense, the air is much thinner than the lower \natmosphere, the bottom ten-ish kilometres (we call it the troposphere, where most of the \nweather sits)... so, to a good first approximation – and you could still say this is reasonable – \nyou could think of the tropospheric motion as given, and afterwards compute the response \nof the stratosphere as a passive response.  And that’s the way we used to think about \nsudden warmings and it gets you... that’s the paradigm upon which Matsuno’s work was \nbuilt, and it gets you quite a long way in understanding them.  However, there is a relatively \nweak back-reaction of... where what happens aloft does react back on the troposphere, \nespecially if you’re looking at subtle, you know, slowish things going on, like, you know, just \nhow long does a severe winter last.  That sort of thing involves a lot of complicated fluid \nmotions and radiation and chemistry.  It’s getting more like the ozone-hole problem, to get a \nfull handle on this. It’s very sensitive [for one thing] to how the water vapour’s carried around \nin the atmosphere.  So that’s a very complicated problem, but the evidence is becoming \nfairly clear, that there is an influence from the stratosphere. \n \nThat of course is why modern weather forecasting models routinely include the stratosphere \n– which is why our blurred view of reality [as it then seemed] can now be seen very clearly \n[relatively un-blurred] in weather forecasting model output, as you can see in recent talks of \nmine [e.g. the Haurwitz Lecture already mentioned].  Courtesy of Adrian Simmons, by the way.  \nAdrian Simmons – remember, I said – was my first research student, who fooled me into \nthinking that all Cambridge research students were as brilliant as he was [laughs]. \n \n[0:39:33] \n \nAnd could you then tell the story of your involvement in ozone science? \n \nWell, of course, I’m just a fluid dynamicist, but of course to crack the ozone-hole problem we \nneeded communication between the different specialists, so I learnt, you know, quite a bit \nabout the most important side of the chemistry and radiation problems. \nMichael McIntyre Page 151 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n151 \n \nRadiation is technically intricate, but it’s very well developed.  And the people who work on \nit have very complicated computer codes.  The reason [one of the reasons] is that the \ngreenhouse gas molecules… any molecule with more than two atoms is a greenhouse gas.  \nThat’s a simple consequence of the frequency range of floppy vibrations of the molecules \nthat interact with infrared radiation.  But actually getting the details right is an intricate \nquantum problem, and it has to be checked by careful lab work.  So there’s a whole \ncommunity who try and get all that right.  And we think it’s done fairly accurately in today’s \nmodels.  That’s about the least of our problems in the models. \n \nThe chemistry is very complicated, but people who understand it better than I do have \ndiscovered how to simplify it, and put all the... you know, there are hundreds of reactions \ngoing on, hundreds of  ‘constituents’ [chemical species], but they can group them into \n‘families’ [by recognizing different timescales – fast and slow reactions] and get simplified models.  \nIt’s a bit like understanding the dynamics by looking at just the PV.  You know, you spot what \nthe simplifying features are, and get a better intuitive grasp of it.  Well, they’ve done that.  \nSo I have a bit of second-hand understanding of that side of it. \n \nBut when did you first feel that you were working on that problem, that you were sort of \nconsciously… if you were… deciding to apply what you knew to… engaging with discussions of \nozone depletion and... ? \n \nYes.  I don’t... let’s see.  I think my awareness of that side of it developed gradually.  You \ncould hardly go to a meeting on stratospheric warmings and such, without hearing \nsomething about the chemistry.  Because the chemistry was significant for observing, don’t \nforget.  By...  The basic way of observing the stratosphere from space is by clever infrared \nspectrometers.  And you can learn a lot about the chemical composition from those, \nbecause all the molecules have their own infrared signatures, thanks to this same \ncomplicated quantum business.  And so you can look at how the methane and the ozone and \nMichael McIntyre Page 152 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n152 \nvarious other things… some nitric oxides… And quite a number of constituents can be sensed \nfrom space. \n \nSo there would always be talks about... you know, here’s the distribution of such and such a \nchemical, how do we understand that; and fluid dynamicists like me would get involved \nbecause quite a lot of them… you had to understand them because of the way... because of \nthe mean circulation of the stratosphere.  This is, broadly speaking, a rather simple mean \nflow, where…  By ‘mean’ I mean the mean around latitude circles.  If you average around \nlatitude circles [and use the ‘transformed Eulerian mean’], you get this systematic rising motion \nin the tropics, and poleward motion and then downward near the poles.  It’s called the \nBrewer–Dobson circulation, because Dobson [Gordon M. B. Dobson] was a pioneer in ozone \nobservations from the ground, and began to suspect that there had to be such a circulation \nto account for the observed ozone.  You see a lot more ozone in places quite different from \nwhere you expect it to be produced by, you know, [ultraviolet] sunlight photolysing oxygen.  \nSo Dobson had this clue.  And then Brewer – Alan Brewer – was a very clever observer, who \nmade the first credible observations of stratospheric water vapour. \n \nThis was... I think it was actually during the Second World War.  He [Brewer] was put on to \nthis problem because, in the war, they were concerned about condensation trails from high-\nflying bombers, and so they cared a lot about how moist the air was at high altitudes.  And \nquite a lot of the time these bombers were in the stratosphere.  And so of course if you want \nto fly without leaving a contrail you try and get into the stratosphere.  And knowing when to \ndo that was all to do with having a good weather forecast, of course.  Anyway, from this, \nBrewer developed a way of measuring the moisture in... the humidity in the stratosphere, \nwhich is technically quite difficult, because the stratosphere is very dry.  And he made the \nfirst credible measurements of that, and verified, yes, it is very dry.  It really is very dry.  How \non earth does it get so dry? \n \nAnd the only way he could think of was this circulation.  Somehow the air must be getting up \nin the tropics, where the lower stratosphere is very cold, and the water vapour’s freezing-\nout there – forming cirrus clouds and such – and [the remaining air] carrying on into the rest \nMichael McIntyre Page 153 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n153 \nof the stratosphere in a much drier state.  And so his name is, in my view quite rightly, \nattached to the idea of this circulation.  He clearly said there had to be such a circulation, or \nwe can’t make sense of what we observe. \n \nBut he also, being an honest scientist, said, I haven’t a clue how this works!  Because at first \nsight it violates angular-momentum conservation – okay?  Because if you had nothing but \nthat circulation... just visualise, if you’ve got upward motion in the tropics, and then \npoleward motion, now if that’s all that was going on, the whole stratosphere would spin up \nlike crazy – from a huge ballerina effect, you see – and the wind speeds would be far \nstronger than they are observed to be.  And that [the stratospheric winds not being so strong] \nwas already known, I think, from some balloons and such… aircraft measurements.  So \nDobson – sorry, Brewer –  realised that that didn’t make sense.  But he said so in the paper: \n“I haven’t a clue why this is.”  And it was a long time before, you know, people like me \nunderstood why – which was exactly the momentum transport by waves, in this case mainly \nRossby waves – that’s what cracks that problem as well.   \n \n[0:45:42] \n \nAnd I did mention already, didn’t I, this thing called ‘gyroscopic pumping’, remember? \n \nYes, yes. \n \nWell, I’m talking about Einstein’s ‘tea-leaves experiment’, and you saw the video of that. \n \nYes. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 154 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n154 \nAnd so you have a rotating mass of fluid.  If by any means you exert a retrograde force on it, \nyou will gyroscopically pump the fluid toward the rotation axis.  [Viewed in a frame of reference \nrotating with the mass of fluid, the pumping action can be thought of as a Coriolis effect.  You \npersistently push the fluid retrogradely, and the Coriolis force persistently turns it inward.] \n \nThat is exactly what these breaking Rossby waves do, because if you go into the theory of \nthat, and the consequence of rearranging the PV on all the stratification surfaces, you \nrearrange it and you invert… one of the consequences is that the... effectively, the \nstratosphere feels a retrograde force, because of the breaking waves.  It’s just like the force \ndue to breaking ocean waves on a beach – that exert a force and generate a longshore \ncurrent.  The details are quite different, but fundamentally it’s similar [as regards the genesis \nof the force].  So you get this retrograde force from breaking Rossby waves, and that [force] \ngyroscopically pumps fluid poleward.  And that’s what drives this Brewer–Dobson \ncirculation.  And I can’t claim that I’m the only one to have understood this, but I can claim \nthat the sort of fluid dynamics I’m talking about is absolutely central to understanding it. \n \n[0:46:52] \n \nSo this pumping is what takes ozone from the tropics, where... from... I understand from \nwhat you’re saying, more of it is likely to be produced by the action of light on oxygen. \n \nThat’s right. \n \nAnd that explains why there’s so much ozone observed in the poles, where you wouldn’t \nexpect to see as much as that, because of the pumping of fluid, and therefore the chemicals \nthat it contains, in this case ozone, to the pole. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 155 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n155 \nYes.  That’s a very important part of that story.  You could say it’s perhaps the... to a first \napproximation, how it works.  The ozone is formed most rapidly in the upper tropical \nstratosphere.  Or summer actually; I mean, at solstice the sun[shine] is strongest at the \nsummer pole, remember.  The Earth is tilted enough that actually it goes all the way to the \npole.  But all the... so in the sunlit upper stratosphere you’re forming ozone at a great rate.  \n[Especially at altitudes around 40–50 kilometres in the summer hemisphere.] \n \nNow I have to be a little careful how I say this, because if I do nothing but move the air from \nthere to somewhere else, and I do it slowly enough that the... I maintain chemical \nequilibrium... okay, if I take a piece of air with solar ultraviolet hitting it, there’s a certain \namount of ozone, because there’s an equilibrium between the rate of formation and the \nrate of destruction.  This goes back to work by Sydney Chapman in the 1930s, and now we \nhave... well, we have a very sophisticated picture of all this, taking account of all the other \nchemicals.  But the bottom line is that, in the brightly sunlit upper regions, you’ve got a fast \nchemical equilibrium time.  So if you just move air around, nothing happens, except that it \njust adjusts to its new equilibrium when it gets into less sunlight. \n \nBut there comes a point where it’s getting out of the sunlight, and the chemical reaction \ntimescales are slowing, and becoming more comparable with the fluid transport timescale.  \nSo there’s a subtle transition to a situation where a fluid parcel can carry the last ozone \nconcentration that was established by the sunlight – carries it into the shade – and from \nthen on the ozone is more or less inert.  And, from then on, it can be carried all the way \ndown into the lower stratosphere by the descending – this is in the polar stratosphere – by \nthe descending branch of the circulation.  So that’s, you know, part of that story.  I think \neveryone would agree, the circulation is critical.  Getting the circulation right is critical to \ngetting everything else right in that problem. \n \nNow this, by the way, is classical ozone chemistry.  It’s nothing to do with the ozone hole, \n’cause the ozone hole depends on another set of chemical reactions that come mainly from \nman-made chlorofluorocarbons [in a different chemical-reaction setting].  (The evidence from \nthat is overwhelming, and crosschecked in very many ways [as I said before], even though the \nMichael McIntyre Page 156 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n156 \nprofessional disinformers kept trying to discredit it; but never mind, that’s past history now.)  \nSo that’s another set of reactions, that depend on having solid or liquid surfaces, these hazes \nthat you get in the very cold lower stratosphere – especially in the Antarctic, but it’s \nhappening in the Arctic too, a bit, especially in the colder winters. \n \n[0:50:04] \n \nCould you explain why Joseph Farman’s spectrometer at Halley Bay and the other one at \nArgentine Islands in the Antarctic... why they were in a particularly good place to spot ozone \ndepletion? \n \nThat’s a very good question, and the answer is that the main ozone depletion takes place in \nthe core of the polar vortex.  Now I haven’t talked about the jet going round the edge of the \npolar vortex very much.  But this whole business of Rossby-wave breaking, and mixing of \npotential vorticity especially outside the vortex, in this case – which Tim Palmer and I saw \nwith our very own eyes, and which we can now see in fine detail – that very same thing \nmakes the jet sharper.  And that has two consequences.  One is that the Rossby-wave \nelasticity, if you will – it’s a slightly loose term, but [I’m referring to] the wave mechanism – is \nconcentrated at the vortex edge where the steepest gradients of potential vorticity are \nconcentrated, after this mixing process.  Remember, you’re mixing only [or mainly] outside, \nso you’re actually sharpening the [PV] gradients in the jet core [i.e. at the vortex edge].  So \nyou’re sharpening the jet [making its velocity profile narrower].  And that, by the way, is an anti-\nfrictional effect.  It looks like complete nonsense by all classical turbulence theories.  That’s \nanother great story... I might come to a bit more. \n \nBut you’re sharpening the jet... so, you’re making the edge more elastic, ’cause the PV \ngradients are more concentrated.  (Remember I said that ‘PV gradient’ is [approximately] a \nhorizontal gradient in the stratification surface.)  They [the PV gradients] are the source of the \nRossby-wave mechanism, so they have a sort of restoring effect: if you push the edge of the \nMichael McIntyre Page 157 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n157 \nvortex, it wants to bounce back in a peculiar elastic way, because of the Rossby-wave \nmechanism. \n \nNow that mechanism is most effective on the largest scales, as it turns out.  That’s because \nof the peculiarities of PV inversion.  But there’s another thing, which is the shear.  By \nsharpening the jet, you’ve created more shear near the edge.  And that supplements the \nRossby elasticity by shredding pieces of air.  So if a blob of air with different chemistry wants \nto try and get across the edge, it tends to get shredded before it gets there.  So the two \neffects, in combination, create what we call an ‘eddy-transport barrier’.  It’s very hard for \nchemicals to get across the edge, especially from the outside into the inside.  So we can \nthink of the inside of the vortex as a sort of chemical ‘containment vessel’, as I once called it, \nin which the ozone-depletion chemistry can carry on without much contamination from \noutside.  And that’s now recognised, I think, as a part of that story.  So there’s two things.  \nOne is, it’s relatively isolated – it’s difficult to mix stuff in[to] there.  And [secondly] it’s also \ncold [promoting haze formation],  just because of the dynamics of the vortex swirling round, \nand the radiation [the cooling-to-space that created the vortex in the first place]... \n \nWhy does that vortex form over where Joe had his mass spectrometer? \n \nOh, I haven’t answered your question.  It just happens that, because of the geography of the \nsouthern hemisphere, the polar vortex [core – whose area is comparable to that of the Antarctic \ncontinent] tends to be displaced a little bit toward the Halley Bay [area] – of course you can \nmake all these observations perfectly well at the South Pole – it isn’t displaced all that much; \nbut it is displaced away from the American station at McMurdo Sound.  So actually Halley \nBay, which is on the sort of South American, the Atlantic, side, that’s actually not a bad place \nfor – quite often – seeing the vortex core, inside this eddy-transport barrier.  So that’s why \nthey saw the depletion there. \n \nAnd could you explain why it forms at all, why this vortex forms there at all? \nMichael McIntyre Page 158 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n158 \n \nOh right.  Well, okay, that’s first of all down to radiation.  The jet round the edge is often \ncalled the ‘polar-night jet’… for the very good reason that in the winter stratosphere the \npolar cap sees no sunlight at all, it is the polar night.  And that means that the heat radiation \nbalance still involves infrared cooling to space, but no compensating heating from the Sun.  \nAnd, well, that means that the core of the vortex tends to get cold.  And that would happen \nwithout any of the fluid dynamics.  So even with no fluid dynamics you still get some kind of \nvortex, but it would be a more broad, spread-out sort of thing with a broader jet.  What the \nfluid dynamics does... well, it actually does two things: one is to sharpen the jet by this \nRossby wave-breaking process, and the other is to... actually make the vortex less strong \nthan it would otherwise be.  And that’s because of the Rossby-wave breaking, and \ndissipation by infrared damping as well, because the infrared radiation acts as a damping \neffect.  It’s a sort of thermal relaxation – hotter air radiates more strongly to space, so \ntemperature anomalies tend to get ironed out – and that’s a damping effect on the Rossby \nwaves.  And when you damp Rossby waves, either by breaking or by infrared damping, you \nirreversibly transport angular momentum.  There is another wave–mean interaction effect, \nand the sign of that is such that you slow down the vortex.  Remember, it’s a retrograde \nforce.  It’s the same thing that’s doing the gyroscopic pumping; and it also slows the vortex.   \n \nAnd so could you explain then how this vortex breaks up?  ’Cause I understand that it’s the \nbreaking up of the vortex that’s involved in the depletion, partly. \n \nYes... well... mm... the sudden warmings, the strongest ones especially, are events in which \nthe vortex more or less breaks up.  And you could think of that as a Rossby wave whose \namplitude has got even bigger than before, so it, you know, completely destroys the very \nthing it propagates on, if you will.  It stops... it starts being a bit futile to talk about waves at \nthat point.  It’s probably better to talk about the whole thing as nonlinear vortex \ninteractions.  What you see is... one thing you see is the Matsuno-type scenario, where the \nvortex splits like an amoeba, and if it splits far enough up, it may well get largely shredded \nup, or greatly reduced by the shear flow it gets into.  The other flavour of warming, which is \nactually a commoner one, is where the vortex gets displaced an enormous distance off the \nMichael McIntyre Page 159 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n159 \npole.  It’s a wave-one disturbance, if you will.  But again, if it’s too strong, then it tends to \nbreak up.  It [the vortex core] tends to get seriously eroded.  You get intermediate cases \nwhere it gets displaced, and eroded, and worn – you know, the core is made smaller; it... the \nbreaking mixes stuff off the edge, it erodes the whole thing – but then the remnant of it gets \nback over the pole.  So, you know, there’s a whole variety of scenarios that the observers \nstudy. \n \n[I could have added, to answer the question better, that most of the ozone depletion takes place \nwhile the vortex is still more or less intact.  It takes place within the vortex core, i.e. inside the \nsurrounding eddy-transport barrier.  After that, when the vortex breaks up – usually in the late spring \nin the case of the Antarctic – pieces of ozone-depleted air wander around, and can arrive overhead in \nAustralia, for instance, posing a hazard to sunbathers.] \n \n[0:57:14] \n \nWhat was the nature and extent of your family’s interest in your work at this time?  And by \nthis time, what we’re saying now is the ’70s and early ’80s, I suppose.  So you’ve got children \nwho are getting older, and your wife, Ruth, as well.  To what extent do you... yes, well, the \nfirst question really, what is the nature and extent of their interest in what you’re doing, or \neven involvement in what you’re doing? \n \nWell, I have to say, most of the time they weren’t very interested.  But you can... I can \nsympathise with them because, as you can see from this interview, it’s quite hard to \ndescribe the technicalities of my sort of work.  You know, if I was just an observer and \nproduced lots of maps and... hey, look at this spectacular event here, they could have \nfollowed it more easily.  But there you go.  You know, I tried to, you know, reach some sort \nof work–life balance.  They would claim, of course, it was too much work and not enough \nlife, but there you go. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 160 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n160 \nI mean, our concertising in the 1970s was part of that balance, which actually I found I \ncouldn’t sustain.  So I don’t know, I... on a broader front, I mean, I think my two boys, my \nstepsons, were both interested in science in a more general way.  The younger one, Peter, is \nnow a venture capitalist, and he seems to have a brilliant way of grasping the essentials of \nsome new technology, and judging whether to try and get it to market.  That takes a very \nflexible and scientifically-aware sort of mind, and he’s always been... well, in a way, a bit of a \nmaverick like me. \n \nHe got rather impatient with school [in his mid-teens], and went off to New Zealand and \n[laughs] I always said, that’s when his real education started.  He went and worked for the \ntax department.  What better training for getting into business can you imagine – actually \nseeing how the real bureaucracy works?  And he did all sorts of other things: worked in a \nsteam-engine museum, and... oh... played around with old cars.  He’s a great guy.  He’s got a \nlovely family now, and they’re doing very well with venture capitalism [and their family life].  \nHe’s been... you know, he talks to me from time to time about things he does.  Some \nmedical advances, better ways of treating disc problems in the back, and so on, using new \nplastics technologies.  Better ways of cleaning water without wasting so much energy, by \nbeing a little cleverer with the chemistry – amazing stuff. \n \nAnd my other stepson, Jonathan, he’s more of a computer guy.  He maintains the IT, or part \nof the IT system, in a business.  He became a Buddhist, and so it’s a Buddhist-run business – \na lot of lovely people there, who have a high ethic, and they work together well.  So he... we \nsee him quite regularly.  He spends about three days a week in Cambridge, because that’s \nwhere the headquarters is.  He spends the rest of the time in London.  And he... you know, \nhe tells us a bit about their travails with trying to get these systems working robustly.  It’s \nvery complicated.  It’s a terribly stressful thing actually.  They’re commissioning a big new \nsystem now.  To try to judge whose services to buy and who to avoid – whom to avoid I \nshould say [laughs]... \n \nAnd the daughter [Miriam], she’s not scientifically minded at all, but she’s a lovely person and \nshe’s had quite a hard life actually.  She, well, mainly supports her husband, I think. Works as \nMichael McIntyre Page 161 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n161 \na secretary.  [She also does genealogical research in her spare time, and has recently published a \nbook on this: Plashet – Gone, But Not Forgotten]  They’re out in Australia.  He’s a food safety \ninspector.  So there you are.  So the answer to your question is, not all that much, but \nperhaps in a broader sense some influence, I hope. \n \nWhat happened when you did try to... did you try to explain what you were doing and what \nhappened if you did? \n \nOh, I always... I believe, especially with youngish children, that you’ve got to go with the \nflow.  You’ve got to try and sense what they’re interested in, and do your best to satisfy that.  \nWith the younger one, Peter, I... you know... I’ve told you about my interest in model \naeroplanes and electronics.  Well, he went the same way, mostly with electronics, when he \nwas little.  So, you know, I played with those things with him.  The older one, he was more of \na sort of intellectual, and in those days he hadn’t developed his interest in computers \nespecially.  He’s... how would one describe this?  You could imagine he might have become a \nlawyer.  He was interested in arguing, and in logic, you know, and in beating people in \ndebates, and so on.  In fact he was jolly cruel to his little brother for a while.  We had to kind \nof get him to hold off, because he could always dominate the discussion by being clever with \nthe, you know, argy-bargy [laughs]. \n \nAnd what about your wife, Ruth?   \n \nWell, she’s a great artist with music... well, she’s a wonderful artist in a number of ways.  She \ndoes lovely paintings.  She’s had phases that she does one thing or another.  She’s become a \ngreat culinary artist.  She follows MasterChef assiduously, and she creates wonderful things \nto eat.  She threw a huge seventieth birthday party for me last summer, and we had about \nfifty people along to the village hall.  And she masterminded quite an elaborate spread, of a \nbuffet lunch, with many delicious things in it.  I kept saying... the planning for this lasted \nmonths and months and I kept... ‘Darling, we should... look, we should just splash out and \nget a good caterer in, shouldn’t we?’  But no, she had the bit between her teeth.  It was a \nMichael McIntyre Page 162 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n162 \ncreative project.  And she still plays music, although not professionally any more; but she’s \ngot a lovely amateur group that plays around [and gives informal concerts] with clarinet-cello-\nand-piano trios, in fact. \n \n[1:03:17] \n \nLooking through your list of publications, as we did at lunch...  Every now and again, fairly \nregularly, appears a publication which is not about atmospheric dynamics, but which is about \nacoustics, and about the production of music.  And so I wonder whether you could talk \nabout... well, describe that work, but indicate in that also the origins of it, how it was that \nyou were combining those different kinds of research.  \n \nYes.  Well, they... it started quite simply... of course I was still playing the violin \nprofessionally; so I was interested in the finer points of violin sound, and playability, and so \non... how to get different tone colours...  And suddenly along comes a young man called Jim \nWoodhouse, who is now – well, he’s now a Professor of Engineering at Cambridge.  But Jim \ncame to me and told me that he made violins.  He was in the local violinmaking class.  He \nwas obviously a skilled craftsman, and he made pretty good violins.  And he wanted to do for \nhis PhD a study of the acoustics of violins. \n \nAnd I said, “Well, I’d love to get involved in that, even though, you must be warned, I haven’t \never really thought about it.  If you don’t mind [us] learning the subject together, I’ll be your \nsupervisor.”  So... and that was the right way to jump – although I had no way of knowing – \n’cause Jim was actually one of the most brilliant research students I’ve ever had: [among] the \nmost brilliant, well, two or three, I suppose.  He had, just instinctively, a flair for how to do \nresearch.  He could quickly put his finger on what was significant.  And if he didn’t know \nabout it, he had a way of finding out who did know about it, and going and picking their \nbrains.  So not just me, but other people; and very quickly we had a lab setup – because he \nwent and talked to people in the Control Engineering lab, and persuaded them into letting \nhim use their computers, and analogue-to-digital converters, and so on, which weren’t... you \nMichael McIntyre Page 163 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n163 \nknow, they were real research tools.  And they’re sort of common as dirt nowadays, but in \nthose days you had to be a little ingenious to get a setup like that. \n \nSo we rather quickly had a setup where we were thinking about violin vibrations, and \nmeasuring some aspects.  And the work developed into two strands.  One was \nunderstanding how the bowed string work[s], and the other about wood vibrations, so I \nlearnt a bit about the elastic theory of anisotropic materials like wood.  I mean, every \nviolinmaker knows that the wood properties are critical to making a good violin – especially \nthe front of the instrument. \n \nDoes anisotropic mean it’s got sort of complicated internal structure? \n \nIt does sort of mean that, but what it really means is that different directions have different \nproperties.  So it’s just the fact that the wood has a grain, so it’s stiffer to bend in one \ndirection than another, that’s all.  And the point about violin fronts is, it’s unusually stiff and \nunusually light.  There are only three or four sorts of wood that are used for violin fronts – \nthings like sitka spruce – that have this lightness-and-stiffness combination.  And that helps \nto get a stronger coupling to the air.  The air, of course, is very light. \n \nSo... and this was all known... but there was a wonderful woman called Carleen Hutchins \nwho’d been trying to open up violin acoustics.  She was trying to do the thing that was done \nfor chemistry in the Renaissance, you know – because, before she came along, mostly \nviolinmakers worked in secret [alchemist-like], and wanted to find the ‘secret of Stradivarius’ \non their own.  But Carleen Hutchins – along with some savvy colleagues who knew physics \nand circuit theory and so on – they wanted to understand violin vibrations better, and to \nlearn how to build good instruments with unconventional dimensions: one of her big \nprojects was to produce a ‘consort of violins’ that had, in some sense, optimal acoustic \nproperties over a whole range of sizes.  So there was a tiny sopranino violin that was an \noctave higher than the ordinary violin, and a huge contrabass thing that was lower than an \nordinary double bass [I should have said, with lower acoustic resonances than an ordinary bass] – \nMichael McIntyre Page 164 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n164 \nand everything in between.  And, you know, some of it... it’s got its own musical character, \nand music gets written for this.  I was quite involved for a time in trying to get it... that [the \nconsort] known in Britain... going to conferences on violin acoustics [and, with help from \nCharles Taylor and Roddy Skeaping, starting a project at the Royal College of Music in London]. \n \nThe other thing that... Carleen Hutchins, as I said... was trying to open it up to scientific... to \nopen science... to get people involved in trying to understand violin vibrations [scientifically] \nand not be secretive about it, but rather, they [would do better to] have meetings and learn \noff each other’s progress.  And she founded a journal called the Journal of the Catgut \nAcoustical Society, which is very much an icon, still, for serious work in this area.  So Jim and I \ngot to know that community, and made some contributions.  We got somewhere with \nunderstanding wood vibration – how to do this mathematically, which is somewhat \ncomplicated even if you do... I mean, linear theory is rather good for the body vibrations.  \nThey’re small amplitude, so nonlinearity isn’t an issue. \n \nBut with the bowed string it’s quite different, because nonlinearity is essential.  It’s critical to \nhow the whole thing works.  And that’s been known for a long time.  This goes back to \nHelmholtz and Raman, the same Raman who famously got his name into spectroscopic \nquantum effects.  (There’s something called the Raman effect, on which some kinds of \ntuneable lasers are based.)  But this same Raman, in his youth, worked on bowed-string \ndynamics, ’cause he was interested in the violin.  So we were able to take the theory beyond \ntheir contributions. \n \nOh, there was a man called Lothar Cremer, whom we got to know personally.  He was a \nfamous acoustician, with a side interest in violin acoustics, and he made some progress in \nmodels of the bowed string.  We were able to take that further, too, because all those \nmodels, up to now [up to Cremer’s work, I should have said], didn’t predict an effect with which \nI was familiar as a musician, which is that if you press too hard with the bow the note... the \npitch drops.  [We called it the ‘flattening effect’.]  And all the standard ideas about string \nvibrations didn’t predict that.  So Jim and I discovered how that worked, by a combination of \nMichael McIntyre Page 165 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n165 \nsimple experiments and simple mathematical models, and it was all a lot of fun.  It was a real \nadvance of fundamental understanding. \n \nAnd the lab work was... you know, in a single afternoon in the lab, you could learn \nsomething significant.  Contrast that with my other interests, which were to observe \n[vicariously! – and to understand]  the stratosphere.  To do that, people had to spend half their \ncareers developing one instrument, and getting through all the fundraising, and \nbureaucracy, and development work that allowed that instrument to fly – something that I \nhugely admire, people who can have that sort of persistence and skill – because I have none \nof that.  I could never do that, any more than jump to the moon [laughs].  Too impatient. \n \n[1:10:44] \n \nCould you describe what you did with the violin bow in a laboratory in order to answer some \nof these questions?  I mean, in detail.  So if we were standing at the lab bench with the two \nof you or with one of you, what would we see you doing with the violin bow? \n \nOh well, should have brought my violin, shouldn’t I?  But perhaps not.  The short answer is a \nboring one.  I would play notes, and we would take measurements –  because we were \nthinking about how the string vibrations worked – and we had some simple ways of \nmeasuring forces.  I think we had a piezoelectric crystal under a leg of the bridge, at one \npoint, so we were taking the signal from that, digitising that and processing it in various \nways, you know, looking at the frequency components; this is Fourier analysis again.  But \nlooking at the waveforms as well. \n \nAnd to me that was the most interesting part, because understanding several things, \nincluding this ‘flattening effect’ where the pitch goes down [is best done directly from the shape \nof the waveform, rather than from the frequency content] – and one or two other things too, \nsuch as the noise that you get, by... I mean, if you hear, y’know, first class violin-playing, \nMichael McIntyre Page 166 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n166 \nsometimes the player will use quite a noisy regime.  You hear a certain amount of ‘grit’ in \nthe sound.  [This is a strong, bright sound made with the bow pressed firmly, and accurately close to \nthe bridge.]  And we discovered the basic mechanism for that, which is to do with the finite \nwidth of the bow. \n \nI don’t think, before our work, anybody had done... other than consider the bow as a single \nline, you know – at one point on the string.  And you can get a fair way with understanding \nthe dynamics that way, but you can’t understand this noise – this particular sort of noise.  \nAnd it turned out that you could begin to understand that with a two-hair model – not the \nmany hairs of the real bow – but two hairs is enough that the short section of string, \nbetween the two hairs, can slip and stick in an irregular way.  [See “Aperiodicity in bowed-string \nmotion: on the differential-slipping mechanism”,  Acustica 50, 294 (1982).] \n \nRemember... I haven’t even begun to explain the basics, but there’s a stick-slip mechanism.  \nThe rosin on the bow has a tendency to stick and then break free – and the usual layman’s \ndescription of how a bowed string works is actually wrong [or half right at best] – it says, oh, \nwhat happens is the bow grips the string and then the string slips and then it grips again.  \nThat’s only half the story, because the other half, that is missed out of that explanation, is \nthat the timing of the stick-slip transitions is controlled by a pulse that propagates back and \nforth on the string.  So the transitions are induced by this pulse passing the bow – okay?  \nAnd that was more or less understood, from Helmholtz onwards, by people who thought \ncarefully about it. \n \nBut creating a nice model of it wasn’t so easy.  Cremer, I think, was the first who really did \nthat.  And we took that further because we created a model that allowed for the stick-slip \ntransitions being different.  They exhibited something called hysteresis.  And that meant that \nthe time delay involved in the transition was different when it went from stick to slip versus \nslip to stick.  That’s why the note flattens when you press too hard – the hysteretical \ndifference. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 167 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 5 \n \n167 \nBut, okay, now if you have two bow hairs, you see, you complicate all that, because now you \ncan get a more irregular set of transitions.  The little section of string between the two bow \nhairs can behave a little more like the layman’s explanation, and... sort of behave in a way \nthat is not entirely timed by this pulse.  By the way, you can demonstrate this by pressing  \nfar too hard.  And then you get a horrible scrunching sound instead of a musical note.  That \nis the sound that corresponds to the layman’s description of bowed-string motion [imitates \nsound] [not very well; it’s really much more raucous].  And so what... the way you get this grit in \nthe sound is by the short section of the string doing a slight scrunch, but the whole thing still \nbeing well timed. \n \nWell, that was quite subtle and interesting.  It’s just curiosity-driven research.  I don’t think it \nhad much impact, as such, on violinmaking or whatever.  We did consider some things that \ndo matter to violinmaking, like how ‘wolf notes’ work.  We even made some advances in \nunderstanding that [and verifying some ideas of Raman; see “On the oscillations of musical \ninstruments”,  J. Acoust. Soc. Amer., 74, 1325 (1983)].   A wolf note is when you... especially a \nproblem on ’cellos, where the string vibration is coupled too tightly to the body vibrations, \nand there’s a nonlinear interaction that gives self-excited oscillations, a bit like the QBO in a \nway, two things interacting.  So the string builds up body vibrations, and the body vibrations \nmodifies the string behaviour, and it flips back and forth from one state to another.  And the \naudible effect of that is, the note – instead of being steady – gets a sort of  brrrrr or \nirregularity, wululululuh, some sort of nasty thing you don’t usually want musically.  And of \ncourse, all ’cellists know that you can buy something called a wolf eliminator, which is a little \nweight you put on one of the short sections of string on the other side of the bridge, and \nthat reduces – if you tune it to the wolf note – it’ll be quite effective at reducing the \namplitude that... [the amplitude] of body vibrations that give rise to the wolf at that \nfrequency.  But we made s... our models actually captured that sort of behaviour quite \nnicely.   \n \n[End of Track 5] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 168 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n168 \nTrack 6 \n \nYou were going to say a little more on the acoustic work. \n \nYes.  Well, I just wanted to say that Jim Woodhouse – the brilliant student with whom I \nworked on violin acoustics – had a... subsequently had a brilliant career; he worked for a \nconsultancy firm called Topexpress for a number of years; and now he’s a professor in the \nEngineering Department here at Cambridge.  And he’s done significant work on other topics, \nsuch as noise in structures, which is quite an important topic for... in various engineering \nproblems, architecture and so on, and...   \n[For instance he found, and refined, a significant application of the idea of  ‘Anderson localisation’  to \nthe noise in complex structures.] \n \nHe still takes students in musical acoustics, among other topics.  Musical acoustics is a \nwonderful way to get a young person, scientifically-minded person, interested.  It’s a \nchallenge to, you know, do lab measurements, do calculations that bear on them, all on a \nsmall scale and in a c... a compact format that’s rather suitable for PhDs.  And it forces you to \nthink hard, because everybody starts thinking acoustics is trivial – which is the impression \nyou get from the average physics textbook – and you realise that to understand acoustics at \na level that matters to, you know, music or architecture – room acoustics for example – it \nreally is quite complicated and challenging.  So he’s had a wonderful career doing all of those \nthings. \n \n[0:01:30] \n \nCould you say something more generally about the enthusiasms of fellow mathematicians for \nmusic in Cambridge?  And perhaps not just in the Department of Maths and Theoretical \nPhysics, but in mathematical sciences more generally?  This may involve friends that you \nknow who were also... who combined interests in maths and music. \nMichael McIntyre Page 169 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n169 \n \nYes.  Well, it’s a sort of... seems to be a generic thing, that mathematically-minded people \nare quite often also musically-minded.  I have a personal theory that this is something to do \nwith what I call our ‘unconscious power of abstraction’.  This is fundamental to how \nperception works.  I’ve written about this a little bit in the Lucidity papers.  Comes in at the \nend of the first paper, for example... but... And I actually think that the connections between \nmathematics and music are deeper than you usually hear about.  I mean, there are brilliant \npeople, like Marcus du Sautoy, who talks very entertainingly about these things.  He’s a very \nclever guy; he knows a lot of mathematics, and he’s a musician as well.  But usually you hear \nthe things about numerical patterns, and not so much the abstract side of it, which interests \nme because – what is abstraction?  It’s the ability to handle very many cases at once.  That’s \nthe essence of a mathematical proof.  You prove something that applies to all triangles \nenclosed in a semicircle, and things like that. \n \nAnd… if you think about how perception works… it must involve an unconscious power of \nabstraction.  The brain must be fitting models to the incoming data, and it must be \nconsidering very many models at once.  It must somehow be handling them all at once, just \nas a mathematician handles many cases at once.  Part of how this works seems to be a kind \nof sensitivity to certain patterns, certain generic kinds of pattern.  You see, this is abstraction \n– this is many things at once. \n \nFor example, organically-changing patterns, patterns in which some things stay the same \nand others change, usually by small amounts – that’s a generic type of pattern to which \nwe’re very sensitive perceptually.  And if you understand that, you can understand a great \ndeal about how music works [including the way harmony works, if you recognize that “small” has \ntwo distinct meanings for musical pitch] – for instance – and other forms of art as well. \n \nYou can see organic change in the visual arts, in poetry of course, and in, well, practically any \nskilful use of language – er, this is one of my bête noirs – most of us are taught at school \nnever to use the same word for the same thing.  “Never repeat yourself,” you know.  But \nMichael McIntyre Page 170 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n170 \nactually, powerful use of language almost always does involve [some] words being repeated, \nbut other things changing – organically-changing patterns, in other words.  Just as in music.  \nMost music that works – I would dare to claim, all music that really works – has repeated \nelements.  How did I get on to that?   \n \n[0:04:50] \n \nThe connection between music and maths!  Well... mathematics, a lot of abstract \nmathematics, for example, is concerned with invariant elements.  You consider a large class \nof objects – they might be numerical patterns, or other sorts of patterns, geometric or \nanything – and common to all these is some... something that stays the same.  I mean, [the] \nKelvin circulation [that] we were talking about is actually a good example of this.  You take all \nthe conceivable ideal-fluid motions of stratified, rotating fluids, with all the possible choices \nof material contours – chains of fluid particles in the stratification surfaces – and, for every \none of these, this circulation thing I was talking about, this line-integral thing – you can \ncalculate it by a perfectly definite formula – that’s invariant, for all these fluid motions. \n \nSo I think that’s an example of what I mean by abstract – you’re grasping lots of cases at \nonce.  PV inversion is an[other] example.  The invertibility principle – you take a very large \nclass of PV distributions – for all of them, it’s true, in a wide range of circumstances.  (I have \nto say [to avoid giving a misleading impression], this is accurately true [only] in a certain range of \nparameter conditions; I mean, you can think of extreme cases where it isn’t true.  If an \nasteroid came by and pulled off half our atmosphere, then you’d be in a different sort of \nfluid dynamics.)   But – in the ordinary fluid dynamics we get in the stratosphere, it’s almost \nalways true that you can deduce from the PV distributions everything else – velocity fields, \ntemperatures, pressures, and so on.   So that’s another rather abstract thing, but useful \nbecause we know we can apply it to so many different cases of Rossby waves, whether \nthey’re breaking or not, etc, etc.  [And a host of other large-scale flow problems, including \ncyclogenesis.] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 171 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n171 \n[0:06:46] \n \nSo could you just clarify in that sense how music is an abstraction, is abstract? \n \nWell, okay.  Now music is... [skirting around the point, trying to set the context first:] I mean, it’s \nvery often used as part of telling some sort of story.  The most popular music is always \ntelling a love story or something or other – personal angst, or whatever it is.  And classical \nart songs, the lieder of Schubert – it’s the same sort of thing.  And music... you have opera, \nyou have tone poems, you have all sorts of... you have film music, very much music in aid of \na narrative... [the] Star Wars music – that’s a beautiful example of the skilful use of the \nlanguage of classical music [in aid of a narrative].  The opening gets you all excited, oh, there’s \ngoing to be a great adventure and great clashes of powerful forces; the music sorts of sets \nthe scene for that. \n \nHowever, if you become deeply interested in music, as I am, you also notice that some \ngenres of music appeal to you on what you might call a ‘purely’ musical basis.  Much of the \nwork of J.S. Bach is a good example – the Preludes and Fugues, the music that’s... you know, \nI’m not thinking about his [overtly] religious output, which does tell stories, but pure music.  \nThe instruments are playing just for the sheer joy of... of being immersed in these patterns, \nand admiring their beauty and feeling their beauty.  Music is a very ‘feeling’ thing. \n \n(I actually have a theory that great musicians probably had mothers who sang and danced \nwhile they were still in the womb, because great musical performances always seem to \ninvolve this unconscious being, this inner game, this inner musician who is both a singer and \na dancer.  And my experience performing music... you know, little things like “I can’t make \nthis piece of music come to life”... but, well, if you play the violin you have this luxury of \nbeing able to walk around.  And if you walk around, and try and move with it, suddenly you \nfeel it coming to life.) \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 172 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n172 \nSo... and the way a lot of that works seems to be quite independent of whether it’s helping \nto tell a story or not.  There seems to be a joy in the beauty of it, the energy of it, the feel of \nit, that’s completely independent of everything else.  So I think there is such a thing as pure \nmusic.  And if you accept that, you have to admit that it is a rather abstract thing!  It’s all \nabout beautiful patterns and their interplay.  [And their unexpected twists.]  And that’s very \nmuch like abstract mathematics. \n \nThere was a wonderful mathematician called Erdős, who’s famous for having collaborated \nwith many people round the world.  His whole life career was avoiding bureaucracy and \npolitics, and not even earning a salary.  His entire life was visiting fellow-mathematicians and \ncollaborating.  And he was such a fertile source of ideas that he managed to live his whole \nlife this way.  And when he or somebody else found a particularly beautiful theorem he \nwould say, “It’s in the book!”  He meant [something like] the book of heaven.  It’s just – \nbeautiful.  It was exactly the sort of reaction we have to a wonderful piece of music, it seems \nto me – and I think for fundamentally similar reasons, that we find a beauty in the sheer \nabstract patterns.  [The more so if there’s an unexpected twist or connection, musical or \nmathematical.  And in some cases there’s furthermore a feeling of transcendence, of awe – a sense of \nsomething far greater than oneself, with huge emotional power.] \n \nNow I think there’s a biological reason for all this, because being interested [unconsciously, \ndeeply, and emotionally] in patterns [as such, as abstractions] – especially organically-changing \npatterns – is a key to survival.  [That’s again because of the role of organically-changing patterns in \nthe way perception works – part of our survival kit – not least in, for instance, perceiving the \ndifference between living things and dead things.]   I think it was selected for.  I mean, I think \nDarwin’s [and Alfred Russel Wallace’s] theory of natural selection is a very powerful key to \nunderstanding how the living world is, and how we are, in particular.  (And of course music \n[also] had particular purposes, such as keeping groups together – you know, tribal solidarity, \nkeeping together, and fighting the next tribe and so on.  But let’s not get too far into that.)  \nMusic is one of the mechanisms involved...  but... [and here’s what I think is more to the point], \nthe ability to survive, and live life, always involves play. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 173 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n173 \nThis is most conspicuous with young animals – of our species and other species.  All of them \nplay.  What is juvenile play?  It’s the very serious rehearsal for real life.  It’s developing your \nskills in the things you need to be skilful in.  So, if you’re a young cat, you have to be skilful in \ngrabbing things and catching them and chasing them – and kittens at play are doing all those \nthings, learning.  We humans have to become skilful in many things, including language, but \nalso social skills of solidarity – and skills of grasping abstract concepts... because we’re \nunusually smart at adapting in creative ways.  And part of those skills, I think, involves... a \nsensitivity to abstract patterns.  [And playing with them gets us emotionally engaged – here’s the \nemotional power again – and music is one form of playing with abstract patterns.] \n \nI think that’s part of why music is important [and why even ‘pure’ music has emotional power]...  \nIt’s difficult to say more, because to take that beyond the level of speculation and plausible \nargument, you need to start to get systematic, and do psychological testing.  And there’s a \nwhole community interested in ‘music and science’.   There’s  a wonderful man called Ian \nCross who works on that here.  He’s a walking encyclopaedia of lots of stuff that’s been done \non this, which is beyond my knowledge.  So... and to take that further you’d have to talk to \nsomeone like him! \n \n[0:13:05] \n \nNow since you started working at Cambridge, and particularly during the 1980s, the \natmosphere as a whole, including the stratosphere, becomes more and more and more the \nfocus for people who are concerned about global warming and climate change.  And I \nwondered – leaving aside the ozone concern, which we’ve covered to some extent – to what \nextent did the concern for global warming... so the... here is the atmosphere becoming \nsomething that scientists and politicians are concerned about, rather than just something \nthat is circulating around the Earth.  When and to what extent did that begin to impinge on \nyour work or... ? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 174 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n174 \nYes.  Well, I’ve always been on the fringe of the climate-science community, although I have \nwatched it quite closely.  And I talk to people who are more closely involved in it, scientists \nwho contribute to the IPCC reports; and all the ones I know personally are very fine and \nhonest scientists – contrary to what many of the disinformers are saying these days.  [I should \nadd that I myself have never received research funding for climate science, as such.]   So I’m quite \nclear about my position: that there is honest climate science [and that it’s reported by IPCC, and \nelsewhere in the peer-reviewed literature].  It’s very difficult and complicated, because if now \nwe’re considering the Earth system almost as a whole, what it looks like depends very much \non the timescale you view it. \n \nAnd there’s been a tendency to focus on the next century, although my own personal view, \nhaving gradually, you know, got to know more about this, and talked to colleagues who work \non palaeoclimate especially – and reading about it – is to gradually realise there are some \nvery simple things about the Earth system that we need to take on board more clearly.  \nThere’s a little piece on my website about this.  And it goes something like this. \n \nRemember I said, in connection with the ozone problem, which of course is part of the \nclimate system, by the way; it isn’t separate... but there was this... you know, when the... \nwhen Molina and Rowland first pointed out there was this possibility of catalytic destruction \nof ozone by man-made [chlorine-containing] chemicals – or their photolysis products – the \nreaction of industry and politicians tended to be, oh, this is... you know, this is a load of \nnonsense.  There’s a lot of chlorine in the atmosphere from natural causes – comes out of \nvolcanoes, and so on.  The man-made part can’t possibly be significant.  Look how tiny the \namount is, they would tend to say.  And there are some people who [seem to] have made \ntheir entire career going around giving lectures to that effect – and I can tell you, one or two \nof those, whose names I happen to know, are now giving lectures about how climate science \nis rubbish – because they’ve given up on discrediting ozone science.  [And their approach is \nwell illustrated by what they said about chlorine – talking naïvely about total amounts – distracting \nattention from the precise mechanisms, and the detailed insights about where different chlorine \nspecies go including the fact that some of them go into the stratosphere, where their effects are \ngreatly amplified by catalysis.] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 175 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n175 \nSo now it’s the same thing [with climate].  Big money says, we’ve got to try and discredit this, \nbecause it’s jolly inconvenient – this whole business about greenhouse-gas emissions, and \nthe change in the climate.  And some people, including eminent scientists like Freeman \nDyson, for instance – I have to say, I’m a Freeman Dyson admirer; he’s a great physicist, he \ndid brilliant work on quantum mechanics in his youth, and he’s done all sorts of brilliant \nthings since then and he writes very interestingly about many problems – but he seems to \nhave decided, in a way that to me seems not quite rational, that climate science is rubbish, \nand climate models are terribly bad, and therefore we should pay no real attention to those.   \n[And even if in reality there were to be a problem, then] we should concentrate on measures to \nchange the climate system artificially, just by engineering and technology.  He seems to have \na kind of... to me, I would say somewhat naïve, faith that this can be done. \n \nBut of course someone of his eminence gets listened to a lot.  And then there are of course \nthe... there’s the, you know, people who are purely political, and driven by money, who \nargue that climate change isn’t a problem.  And they’re very skilful at playing havoc with \nwhat scientists are trying to say – [not only because of their highly-paid professional skills with \nwords, but also] because the reality is very complicated – and the [big climate] models [used by \nIPCC] are very imperfect, and their predictions can’t be entirely right [and so no honest scientist \ncan possibly sound as simple, clear and definite as a skilful propagandist with a particular agenda ]. \n \nOne of the greatest difficulties is being correct about regional climate change.  Now these \nmodels contain fluid-dynamical modules that do the sort of fluid dynamics I’ve been talking \nabout [though still not resolved in sufficient detail]; but they’ve also got to have everything else, \nincluding the chemistry and the moisture, and... things... and the cloud–radiation effects – \nthat’s another very difficult thing, because it’s very difficult to model that accurately.  [And \nanother huge difficulty, important for longer-term predictions, is modelling the so-called carbon cycle \n– which for one thing requires the oceans to be modelled in far finer detail than is possible today.] \n \nAnd this is one reason why, in my own thinking about this in recent years, I’ve tended to say, \nlet’s step back from the climate models a bit, and try and get a bit of perspective on one or \ntwo things that are actually quite simple about the Earth system, if you expand your view \nMichael McIntyre Page 176 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n176 \nand look on a longer timescale.  And [this is the main point on my website] we have a lot of very \nhard evidence that’s completely independent of the climate models, that comes from the \npast – well, the best part of the past million years, 800,000 years to be precise – which are \nmeasurements of gas bubbles [and so-called ‘clathrates’] in ice cores, which tell us... a lot \nabout atmospheric composition over that time.  And there were – how many – seven or \neight ‘ice ages’ during that time, when the climate went between a state a bit like the \npresent state, into an ice age, and back out again [the so-called glacials and interglacials].  And \nevery time that happened, the atmospheric carbon dioxide  [CO2]  went between two very \ndifferent values.  And in round numbers they were [respectively, in glacials and interglacials] 180 \nparts per million by volume and 280 parts per million by volume. \nThis happened again and again.  So you can say that this range, 180 to 280 – of atmospheric \nCO2  – is the natural range of variability, of atmospheric CO2  in the recent geological past, \nwith the Earth system in something like its present state or the ice-age state... much closer \nto [the present]... you know... it’s been much more different from that, if you go back further \nin time.  (The early Eocene [about 55 million years ago], for example, was very hot.  There were \nno great ice sheets.  I think there’s a lot of interesting things to be learnt from that as well.) \n \nHowever, the time for which we have the really hard information is this recent 800,000 \nyears.  And so if you now say, look, we know that carbon dioxide is the most im[portant – see \nbelow]... is chemically very stable in the atmosphere.  Other things like methane – practically \nevery other carbon-containing gas, with very few exceptions, will tend to turn into carbon \ndioxide.  Carbon dioxide is the stable end result of most chemical reactions involving carbon \nin the Earth’s atmosphere.  For example, methane goes into carbon dioxide, in the lower \natmosphere, in a decade or two.  So if we’re looking in the longer timescale, it… putting \nmethane in is almost the same as putting carbon dioxide in. \n \nNow the other thing we know with very high confidence... as a scientist I never say we know \nan absolute truth, remember – that’s for ayatollahs [sorry, I mean something different: \n‘fundamentalists’ of any sort] – not scientists – but with high confidence we know a lot about \nthe radiation physics of carbon dioxide.  We know it’s an important greenhouse gas, as well \nas being chemically stable.  And a quick way to say... how… the significance  [of  CO2] is to say \nMichael McIntyre Page 177 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n177 \nthat carbon dioxide is the... is the most important non-condensing greenhouse gas.  And \nclimate scientists have been a bit slow to point this out.  But it’s an extremely important \ndistinction [condensing versus non-condensing], because the professional disinformers keep \nsaying, oh, look at all the water vapour.  Water vapour is a very powerful greenhouse gas, \nand there’s more of it than carbon dioxide, so it must be more important.  But that’s \ncompletely wrong.  [The same naïveté! Arguing from total amounts alone, with no insight into \nmechanisms.] \n \nAnd this is a very simple point, which is that water vapour can condense or freeze, and \ncarbon dioxide can’t, under terrestrial conditions.  So I say again,  [CO2  is]  the most \nimportant non-condensing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. That gives it a very special \ncase [significance] in regulating the climate system.  And you can see how it works over the \npast 800,000 years by tracing what accompanied those changes in atmospheric CO2 between \n180 and 280 parts per million by volume.  Accompanying those changes were what we \nwould regard as enormous climate changes, with the sea going up and down by more than \n100 metres, that’s [more than] 300 feet.  That’s much more than the single metre or two that \nwe’re worried about for the end of the next century, about which there’s a lot of uncertainty  \n[though the uncertainty is mostly about the timing of the response, as distinct from its ultimate \nmagnitude]. \n \nBut we [therefore] know that changing atmospheric CO2 by that sort of amount can’t be a \nsmall effect.  The professional disinformers keep arguing, oh, it’s much less than water \nvapour, so it must be unimportant.  No… putting in extra CO2 … the palaeo record clearly \ntells us that it’s like injecting an input signal into an amplifier.  The whole system is very \nsensitive to atmospheric CO2 , for very well known reasons of radiation physics.  And what \nhave we done now?  We’ve taken it – in the recent preindustrial past it was 280 parts per \nmillion in round numbers – we’ve now taken it up to more than 390.   [Ands now 400, as I \ncorrect this transcript in 2013.  So the increase already exceeds the natural range of variation, 100, \nthat goes hand-in-hand with very large sea-level changes, sooner or later.]  And it’s going to be \nalmost certainly 600 or 700 before it becomes politically possible to do anything serious.  [So \nthe bottom line is that a very large response is practically certain – sooner or later.] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 178 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n178 \nNow I’m absolute rubbish at politics.  I don’t know what to do politically.  But I suspect that, \nwhen the sea has come up a certain amount, people will realise that the problem is, after all, \nserious, and that they’ve been told a lot of lies by the disinformers, backed by bigtime \nmoney, and that we have to take seriously this business of CO2 emissions and other \ngreenhouse gases.  And, by then, it’ll be more a question of adaptation than mitigation, to \nuse a bit of jargon.  But there are still possibilities for mitigation.  You can bring in various \ncarbon-capture technologies, including taking it back out of the atmosphere.  That’s quite \nexpensive but not impossible – no more difficult then building the Great Wall of China was \nfor the ancient Chinese empire.  If there were the political will to do it, it could be done.  And \nmy eminent colleague, Wally Broecker, who has made these points for a long time, would \nargue that in his book Fixing Climate. \n \nI’d better stop talking about this, ’cause I’ve got some chapter and verse on my website.  But \nthe point to stay with is that the Earth system is a powerful amplifier – although with a very \nslow response [and internally very noisy] – and one of its input signals is injecting extra carbon \ndioxide.  And putting in as much as we’ve put already is already a large input signal, and that \nis going to become a lot bigger before we’ve finished.  And that’s kind of basic fact. \n \nIf there were a disinformer here they’d say, oh, this is alarmist, you mustn’t go \nscaremongering.  My reply is, it’s nothing of the kind; I’m just trying to make an honest \nstatement of what we know [with very high scientific confidence] about the Earth system now.  \nWhat politicians and society does about it is outside my competence.  I just want to try and \nconvey an understanding of one or two basic things that are quite independent of the dodgy \nclimate models  [in particular, the large response to human activity that, sooner or later, can be \nexpected from the noisy but sensitive ‘climate-system amplifier’]. \n \n[0:25:47] \n \nIf you’ve met any of the disinformers, as you call them, and I think you may have met some of \nthem personally, what can you... what light can you shed on their motives, having met them \nMichael McIntyre Page 179 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n179 \npersonally?  What can you tell us about the reasons for saying what they do,  from the point \nof view of someone who’s met them?   \n \nI know one or two of them personally.  One of them is Dick Lindzen.  He’s absolutely \nconvinced that the climate problem is a non-problem.  I don’t personally have much insight \ninto why.  [Actually I think Dick holds a sincere, if mistaken, belief, rather than being a professional \npropagandist or disinformer.]   I’ve gained more insight into that from a book by a man called \nRoss Gelbspan.  This came out, ooh, a decade or so ago.  It’s called The Heat is On,  if I \nremember.  And it’s quite a nice summary of the political arguments that go on, including \nDick Lindzen’s testimony to Congress – testimonies, plural – and a personal interview that \nGelbspan had with Lindzen.  And, well, perhaps I should leave anyone interested to look at \nthat book.  But the bottom line is, Gelbspan says Lindzen... well, he... I have some awareness \nof this.  He [Lindzen] does keep changing his reasons why mainstream climate science is \nwrong, because as people sort of nail down one point, he’ll switch to another.  But I think... \nwell – from what Gelbspan says, and I suppose a bit from my personal knowledge of Dick – \nand by the way, he’s a charming man, and a very clever man, and he’s done some great \nscience – but on the climate problem, I think... it’s like Freeman Dyson.  He simply has a faith \n– it’s [something like] a religious faith – that somehow we’ll come through it, through science \nand technology – and the one thing we mustn’t ever do is to stop Business As Usual.  [Or even \nslightly disturb it.] \n \nBusiness As Usual is the Holy Grail.  It’s all about capitalist economics… economy – making \nmoney.   I don’t know what he would say about the recent failures of capitalist economy, the \nbank bust-ups and all of that.  I don’t know whether he would argue that… still argue… I \nmean, it’s a kind of religious faith, isn’t it, that says Market Forces Are the Answer to \nEverything, in capital letters [regardless of the evidence].  I think that’s basically what he \nprobably believes. \n \n(What a lot of people who believe that... I don’t think, think through clearly, is that to give \nmarket forces a chance to work well, you’ve got to give them a level playing field  [and supply \nthem with correct information!!]  and... unfortunately you don’t have that, because [as well as \nMichael McIntyre Page 180 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n180 \nmassive disinformation] you have all sorts of dirty dealings behind the scenes, where \npoliticians create perverse subsidies, and subsidise some capitalists more than others.  So... \nbut, as I say, what to do about that – I don’t have any political genius – I don’t know.) \n \n[Much earlier I said that on ozone “the disinformers went quiet”; but it might be more accurate to say \nthat on ozone they’re no longer listened to – in responsible circles at least.  I recently came across a \nwell-documented book showing that their professional campaigns continue in all the scientific \nresearch areas that they wish to discredit – for commercial or ideological reasons it seems – including, \nstill, the ozone research: Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on \nIssues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming, by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway, Bloomsbury, \n2010.  It’s a soberly argued, evidence-based discussion and, where it overlaps with my personal \nknowledge, I find it to be substantially correct.  And it seems that my use of the word ‘professional’ \nwas no exaggeration.  Indeed, something I hadn’t fully appreciated is that all the campaigns appear to \nhave revolved, largely, around the same small community of well-paid propagandists, some of them \neminent ex-scientists, whose history and well-honed disinformation techniques go back seamlessly to \nthe earliest campaigns on tobacco and cancer.] \n \n[0:28:44] \n \nYou said a number of times that you couldn’t yourself be a politician, but I wondered what \nyour own personal political views, voting habits, possibly even engagements were, in the ‘70s \nand ‘80s, when you looked out on what was going on. \n \nWell, I suppose I... I’ve never been intensely political; but I suppose I’m going to be shoved \ninto some sort of left-wing pigeonhole if it’s going to get political, aren’t I?   \n[There we are – straight away into that tired old false dichotomy, ‘left’ versus ‘right’.]  Because I \ndon’t actually believe in solving problems by bombing people out of existence, like the \nneocons seem to have done when they went into Iraq [riding on another piece of highly \nimplausible disinformation, that Saddam Hussein was allied to al-Qaeda].  I don’t agree with \nthat sort of approach.  I would rather people, you know, got smart about negotiating what’s \nMichael McIntyre Page 181 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n181 \nin everyone’s mutual interests.  We’re in a very bad place at the moment because the \nneocon type of mentality seems to have had it all their own way in the last decade or two. \n  \nSo how do you recover from that; how do you rebuild trust between cultures?  You know, \nwe... and... And our journalists have some[thing to answer for]...  again, I don’t know what to \ndo about this.  You sell newspapers by trivialising and... sensationalising things and, you \nknow... [for instance] instead of recognising that all the main religious groups have their \nmoderates, you label a given religion as all extremists, don’t you, ’cause it sells more \nnewspapers, I think.  I don’t know what to do about that.  If I were more skilful at debate and \npublic speaking, I might try to speak on the side of moderation and, I don’t know, some sort \nof... I’m not saying I want to go to a purely ‘socialist’ command economy like the old Soviet \nUnion, because I think I agree with Winston Churchill that “democracy is the worst political \nsystem, apart from all the rest.”  So the old Soviet Union was definitely worse. \n \nBut, you know, we live in interesting times, don’t we?  We have the emergence of a \npowerful capitalist economy, China, which is going to dominate the world in many ways.  \nAnd they’re not a democracy, yet, but there is an argument that says they’ll have to become \nmore democratic ’cause otherwise they’ll implode.  It’ll be interesting to see what happens.  \nI couldn’t predict. \n \n[0:31:15] \n \nCan you say something about personal relations with palaeoclimatologists, possibly \nCambridge ones but perhaps others? \n \nWell, I’ve talked a lot to... well, [for instance] I knew Nick Shackleton, who was a very famous \npalaeoclimatologist.  I knew him quite well personally.  That was partly through music, but of \ncourse I was interested in the [palaeoclimatological] sort of thing he does [did].  And this is \nMichael McIntyre Page 182 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n182 \nagain this line of research about the past million or so years, the Quaternary epoch of the \nPleistocene. \n \nNick’s own work was more on looking at ocean sediments, and the small animals embedded \nin them called foraminifera.  And they’re a good source of information ’cause you can... grab \ntheir shells.  And you know that some of them live near the surface of the sea, and some of \nthem lived all their lives on the bottom, and if you analyse the isotopes in their shells – of \n[oxygen and] carbon and magnesium and calcium and so on – you can get some information \nabout temperatures and ocean composition [and ice-sheet volume].  It’s very hard to \ndisentangle all this information, but people have made progress [not least Nick himself].  I \nadmire the meticulous, laborious, and careful work they do. \n \nAnd so we have some idea of... you know, it’s not just the carbon dioxide in ice-core bubbles \n[and clathrates].  That’s correlated with a lot of other information from ocean sediments and \nother sources, like... deposits in caves, and pollen on the bottom of lakes, and all sorts of \nthings.  So the answer to your question is, I don’t know many of the people who do this, but I \nlook on their work from afar and admire them. \n \nNick Shackleton’s last student is a very bright young man called Luke Skinner, who is now a \nrising star in the field.  He’s doing a lot of work on ocean radiocarbon, and he works with \nforaminifera.  Being Nick’s student, that would be a natural takeoff point.  And we’ve talked \na lot about... you know, how did the ocean swallow all that CO2 in glacial times?  Remember \nit goes from 280 to 180 in the atmosphere; that’s a lot of CO2 to put somewhere.  And \neverybody believes the abyssal ocean is the place where most of it went.  [This is the ocean \nbelow depths of a kilometre or so, all the way down to the bottom, mostly at around 5 kilometres.  \nThe abyssal ocean is the only place where there seems to be enough capacity to store so much CO 2 , \nas bicarbonate ions etc.] \n \nAnd that interests me as a fluid dynamicist, because it’s [partly] a fluid-dynamical problem: \nunderstanding how it got into the ocean but then how it got [almost] sealed up there, for a \nMichael McIntyre Page 183 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n183 \nlong time [very many millennia], until finally it came out... most recently about, you know, 15 \nto 10 thousand years ago.  That was the last deglaciation, that led to our present climate. \n \nAnd, you know, there’s a subtle feedback process going on... that the climate disinformers... \n[would like to ignore – they] pick out particular time series and say, oh, look, look, the \ntemperature went up before the CO2 there.  Therefore, they say, the temperature must be \ncausing the CO2 rather than the reverse.  It’s like \ntaking a complex web of cause and effect – think of a complex integrated circuit in which all \nsorts of electrical stuff is going on – it’s all interconnected; you pick two places [within the \ncircuit] where one signal is slightly ahead of another in time, and it’s... oh, that one causes \nthe other one, you say.  Which is terribly naïve, because [to understand such a complex circuit – \nthis is my noisy amplifier again] you’ve got to consider all the other thousands of signals, and \nhow their interplay goes on.  [For instance, the two signals you’re looking at might both be \nfollowing some other signal, or signals, that you’re ignoring.] \n \nAnd I think a well-informed person on these matters would say, what’s actually happening is \nthe Earth-system amplifier has another small input, which comes from subtle changes in the \nSun’s rays, because the Earth’s orientation and position in the Earth’s orbit – which is slightly \nelliptical – changes in time.  And this is well known from celestial mechanics...  And the \nupshot is that things happened like, the poles are [sometimes] more strongly illuminated in \nwinter [and at other times more weakly].  And if you’re in a glacial time with a big ice sheet in \npolar latitudes, it can matter a lot exactly how much sunshine arrives in polar latitudes \n[especially northern latitudes].  And that changes a bit, because of the Earth’s orbital changes. \n \nSo any well educated person... I’m sure Luke Skinner would agree, that the sort of thing \nthat’s happening [in a deglaciation] is that the orbital change begins to melt the ice sheet [in \nnorthern latitudes], and then other things follow in a complicated chain of events, including \nchanges in ocean circulation [e.g. from meltwater pouring into the North Atlantic], and changes \nin sea-ice cover  in the Antarctic, and all sorts of things...  that result in temperature changes  \nand  CO2 changes.  But…  the CO2 that comes out rein[forces]… It may be that the \ntemperature changes first [e.g. on a northern ice sheet], but then the CO2 comes out of the \nMichael McIntyre Page 184 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n184 \n[abyssal] ocean  [mainly via the Southern Ocean, we think – for good fluid-dynamical reasons], and \natmospheric CO2 builds up – and straight away there’s a reinforcement of the original \nwarming.  And that’ll produce further warming.  It’s a positive feedback. \n \nAnd the whole deglaciation process probably depends on this whole complex feedback \nchain, which we do not understand in full detail – but we know it happened \n[and we can follow, in great detail, the stages in which atmospheric CO2 increased from around 180 all \nthe way up to 280 parts per million by volume].  And we know that CO2 is a powerful greenhouse \ngas [and that] it is chemically stable, as I said before.  So anyone who thinks that the \natmospheric CO2 isn’t playing a key role in these events is  \n[to coin a phrase]  a fool ! \n \n[0:36:38] \n \nAnd are you able to tell us anything about Nick Shackleton that we might not know from just \nthe sort of ordinary obituaries and that sort of thing, from you having known him?   \n \nOh gosh, it’s probably a little difficult to say much more.  He was a lovely man, and very \nhonest scientist.  He’s the sort of person you could talk to about anything, and have an \nargument about... where you disagreed on the point.  And he would argue back, and the \nwhole thing would be to try and get it right – there was nothing personal.  That’s part of the \njoy of being a scientist, that you’ve got colleagues who care more about arriving at good \nscience than they care about winning arguments, or personal egos.  So… I can name other \npeople like... Nick was certainly one of those.  And he was a humble man, he always deferred \nto the evidence.  He always strove hard to get better evidence  [and with a completely open \nmind]. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 185 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 6 \n \n185 \n[I’ll never forget the first time I heard him give a research seminar – several decades ago, probably in \nthe 1970s.   That was the first time that I heard about his celebrated work, with Jim Hays and John \nImbrie, dating and intercomparing a number of ocean-sediment cores to produce our first really clear \nevidence for the effectiveness of what’s called the “Milanković pacemaker”.  That’s the scientific \nname for the small input to the climate-system amplifier from the Earth’s orbital changes.  Our \nknowledge of those changes over the past million years or more had been refined, around that time, \nby the work of André Berger.  In listening to Nick I was immediately struck by the careful, meticulous, \nand highly ingenious way in which he had approached the whole problem, and the modest but lucid \nway in which he described the progress they’d made.] \n \nAnd he was also a sensitive musician [a clarinettist – also a well known expert on the history of \nclarinet-making], and we had lovely times making music with him occasionally.  His wife who – \nthey both died of cancer, you know – he had a lovely wife [Vivien Law], who was a very [well] \nrespected linguistics expert.  I think she was a Fellow of the British Academy.  [She was \nindeed.  And she knew more than 100 languages.]   But she was also a wonderful musician – \nplayed the flute very well.  I remember a time we played Bach’s Fifth Brandenburg Concerto \nin a chamber-music arrangement, with her playing the flute, and me playing the violin and \nRuth playing the piano.  And she [they, both Vivien and Ruth] played just wonderfully.  So that \nwas the personal dimension, as far as it went. \n \n[End of Track 6] \nMichael McIntyre Page 186 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n186 \nTrack 7 \n \nCould you tell me about relations with your parents over the period that we were discussing \nyesterday, which is really  from appointment at Cambridge onwards, through the ’70s and \ninto the ’80s? \n \nWell, it... obviously, living at the opposite end of the Earth – they were still in Melbourne – \nthat wasn’t… easy...  In those days, of course, I mean, long-distance telephone calls were a \nsignificant expense, unlike today.  But, you know, I’d ring them up from time to time; we’d \nwrite from time to time.  They were always pleased when I, y’know, got on… or... did \nsomething I thought was exciting.  I think... I don’t think there’s anything specially profound, \napart from the fact that, as always, they were wonderful supportive parents. \n \nAnd, you know, it was always a great pleasure to visit them occasionally.  Occasionally one \nwould make the trip to Australia.  And I did admire my mother’s architecture.  They had a... \nlet’s see.  There were three... or two and a half examples would be fair.  (When they moved \nto Melbourne, my father was the founder Professor of Physiology at Monash University; and \nthey promised all sorts of things to tempt him there and then reneged on most of the \npromises afterwards, so he had to go on all the committees and fight for every inch.  But \nnever mind, he bravely did it.)  But they first lived in a house – this is in a part of East \nMelbourne called... well, an eastern suburb, I mean, called Clayton [wrong: Clayton was later – \nthe first house was in another eastern suburb called Mount Waverley].  And they had a very \nbeautiful house there [in Mount Waverley]  that was designed, I think, by a professional \narchitect, but heavily under my mother’s influence. \n \nAnd after a number of years there, they moved to another house that was chosen to be \ncloser to work [this was in Clayton, near Monash University]; so it… I think it was within walking \ndistance.   And that she designed most of [if not all].  And when my father retired [in 1978], \nthey went to live in Tasmania – his old home town of Launceston that I’ve spoken of before \n– and they built a beautiful… another beautiful house that, again, my mother mostly \nMichael McIntyre Page 187 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n187 \ndesigned.  Sitting on a hilltop, commanding wonderful views of the Tasmanian hills and \nvalleys.  You could see Ben Lomond just on the [eastern] horizon, if I remember correctly. \n \nWhat was your mother’s style?  In other words, how would you tell that she’d had an \ninfluence over the architecture? \n \nHow would I tell?  I’m not a sufficient connoisseur of architecture to be able to tell, you \nknow. \n \nI wondered what her particular enthusiasms were, in terms of designing. \n \nOh well, I mean, she had a very sensitive eye for form, and shape, and texture, and colour.  \nAnd everything she did was beautiful to me.  She, I think, admired things like the Bauhaus \nmovement, some of the modernist stuff where you tried to be sparse.  You tried to omit \nneedless details.  You weren’t too ornate.  It’s like good writing where you omit needless \nwords, isn’t it?  [Laughs]  And... so... her houses had a certain slight austerity but also, I \nwould say, warmth... y’know, she was a real artist in what she did – in everything she did.  \n[Her ideals and preoccupations – which included a preoccupation with functionality as well as with \nform and simplicity – are discussed at some length in her interview by Barry Wise, transcript pages \n27–36, where she speaks of having designed six houses, “three for others and three for us”.  Among \nthem she counted our Shiel Hill house, saying “I didn’t know anything then, but it worked – probably \nbecause of my feeling for spaces.”   I would concur.   The ‘other’ three – none of which I saw – \nincluded one for an impecunious but imaginative academic family with six children. ] \n \nWhat did your father do in retirement? \n \nWell, he, like I do now, tried to stay active.  He had quite a few years in which he was active, \nand did collaborative research with his former students or anyone else who was interested.  \nSo he would go and visit Professor Dick Mark in Canberra quite a lot, I remember, and they \nMichael McIntyre Page 188 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n188 \nworked on a special receptor that… the... there’s an animal called the echidna, which is, you \nknow, one of the marsupials of Australia; it’s… or… otherwise called the spiny ant-eater.  It \nhas a long snuffly nose, and a long tongue that it can schloop up ants with, of course.  But it \nhas receptors that are sensitive to electric currents.  And those, among others, were my \nfather’s interests at that time. \n \nHe also did something on receptors that cats have in their foot[pads]... in their paws.  They \nhave very sensitive vibration receptors – and I don’t think anyone knows for sure why, but \nprobably it’s to feel ground tremors.  If you’re a predator you probably want to feel if some \nprey is walking around nearby.  But anyway, they’ve certainly got these very sensitive \nreceptors. \n \nIn fact, one of the ways my father used to tell our pet cats to get off the dining table would \nbe just to bang the surface – which apparently the cats found rather a big hit on their paw \nreceptors; so they’d usually jump off [laughs].  So he was, you know, basically still active in \nhis area, and still a respected researcher.  And I think he felt he was to some extent catching \nup on research, after a pretty gruelling period as Head of Department and… administrator at \nMonash. \n \nAnd what was the nature and extent of his interest and understanding of what you were \ndoing in science? \n \nOh well, he’d naturally ask me, and I’d try to explain, in the sort of way I’m trying in these \ninterviews.  And he was quite interested, or he’d always throw up his hands and say, “I can’t \nget my head round the technicalities.”  But then again, I probably could never do the sort of \nwonderfully skilled dissections and measurements he did on nervous systems. \n \n[0:06:02] \nMichael McIntyre Page 189 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n189 \n \nThank you.  You mentioned yesterday that you’d taken part in a flight soon after the ozone \nhole was recognised by Joe Farman and his group. \n \nYes. \n \nCould you first of all talk about the origins of your involvement in that? \n \nWell, as I think I began to say last time, the… we all, everybody working on the stratosphere, \nbecame increasingly aware that the ozone problem might become, you know, a serious \nconcern – not just a scientifically interesting problem.  And of course the discovery of the \nozone hole, the Antarctic ozone hole, in 1985 – or at least it was published in ’85, by Joe \nFarman and Jonathan Shanklin and Brian Gardiner – that was a landmark in the subject.  \nImmediately the Americans verified it, because they took that line of code out of their data \nprocessing [which said that very low ozone values had to be ignored, as unrealistic] and then their \nsatellite images showed the ozone hole in all its spectacular intensity [laughs]. \n \nAnd, from then on, everybody involved – fluid dynamicists, chemists, radiation people – \nwere beavering away, trying to figure out the cause of this, because the chemists hadn’t \nthought of the kind of reaction that was responsible, as I said before.  It was [as recognized \nsubsequently]  on solid or liquid surfaces in these ‘polar stratospheric clouds’, so called, for \nwhich haze would be a better word – sort of thin fog, sort of thing.  Some of them were ice \ncrystals, some of them were nitric acid trihydrate, and then you’ve got liquid ones [tiny \ndroplets] with both sulphuric and nitric acid in them.  And they all provided new sites for \nchemical reactions.  And that made all the difference, and made the [catalytic] ozone \ndestruction far stronger.   \n \nSo that’s... but how is it that you actually went on one of these flights, how did that... ? \nMichael McIntyre Page 190 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n190 \n \nOh well, that was... well, for me that was a sort of optional-extra luxury.  It wasn’t really \nessential to my theoretical work, and the modelling work that people in my research group \nwere doing with computers.  But, well, anyone who’s scientifically-minded, and involved in \nthese problems, wants to see… wants to learn a bit more about how the others involved go \nabout their business – in particular the observers.  And what was critical at the time was to \ngather information about the chemical constituents in the lower stratosphere.  [And I was on \nthe second of a sequence of airborne expeditions to do this, which got started as follows:] \n \nYou know, according to this or that theory of ozone destruction, you expect to see this or \nthat chemical species.  One of the important ones was something called chlorine monoxide, \nwhich is a rather unstable chemical with one chlorine and one oxygen bound together.  And \na group under Jim Anderson, an American group – at Harvard, if I recall – they had a team \nthat created this instrument to measure chlorine monoxide, and they flew it on NASA’s ER-2 \naircraft.  Now the first expedition to do that kind of thing with the aircraft was in, if I \nremember correctly, 1987 – or was it 1988?  Now I’m forgetting.   [In fact August–September \n1987.]   But this is very much on the history books.  They went down to an airbase in Chile – \nPunta Arenas – and based the ER-2 aircraft, and the NASA DC-8, which is a bigger, of \ncourse... a bigger aircraft, a flying laboratory with all sorts of instruments, including lidars \nthat could see the polar stratospheric clouds [above the flight path]... and measured quite a \nfew chemicals at the altitudes at which it could fly  [11–12 kilometres]. \n \nOn the whole, the ER-2 was the more important because it could get higher. The ER-2 is a \ndescendent of the U-2 spy plane.  And it’s got long wings like a glider, and a single jet engine, \na beautiful aircraft.  I sat in the cockpit once, but I wasn’t allowed to fly it because [joking] it’s \na lot harder to fly than a glider, I’m told [laughs].  And actually the people who flew it from \nPunta Arenas into the Antarctic ozone hole – to pick up the chemical signatures, including \nthe chlorine monoxide – they were, you know, ‘right stuff’ pilot people, who actually had to \nbend the safety rules.  You know, if they’d been properly bureaucratic they wouldn’t have \ngone in, because it was quite dangerous.  You had this one jet engine; you didn’t have much \nin the way of safe emergency landing sites.  They were flying down the Antarctic Peninsula – \nif you remember the map – which stretches up towards the tip of South America.  Not much \nMichael McIntyre Page 191 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n191 \nin the way of landing places.  Furthermore... flying into conditions they’d never encountered \nbefore, so they weren’t quite sure how the one jet engine would really behave, in air so cold.  \nSuppose it flamed out and just dumped them?  But they went in anyway, because they knew \nit was important. \n \nThat’s what I call the ‘right stuff’ [laughs].  I met some of these people.  I admire them and \nsalute them, and I mention this when I give talks.  So they went in, behind that single engine.  \nYou’re flying this thing at the sort of altitude – we’re talking about 18, 19 kilometres – and \nthe air’s so thin you’ve really got to wear almost a spacesuit.  You’ve got to wear a pressure \nsuit – looks [and functions] like a spacesuit.  And there’s not much room in that cockpit if \nyou’re wearing this bulky thing, so you’ve got to sort of somehow sort of cope with that long \nlonely flight, and operate all the instruments – do everything all by yourself.  And they \nbrought back critical information.  It’s usually called the ‘smoking gun’.  Yes, there was lots of \nchlorine monoxide!  There were various other things.  It all fitted the new picture of \n[catalytic] ozone depletion due to reactions on hazy particle surfaces – heterogeneous \nchemistry as it was called.  And the rest is history. \n \nThat’s basically our understanding today of how it all happened.  By the way, that’s  the only \nfinal... that’s [the heterogeneous chemistry is] only the final stage in a long chain of events, \nwhich starts with the man-made chlorofluorocarbons – the old aerosol-can and refrigerator \nchemicals, stable as they are, just circulating around in the lower atmosphere and not \nchanging at all – but some of them leaking up into the stratosphere through the tropics.  I \nsaid last time, the mean circulation is always upwards in the tropics, so they get in there; and \nthen they go polewards and downwards.  And on that journey they’re broken up by the solar \nultraviolet, which is much more energetic at those [stratospheric] altitudes.  If you sunbathed \nup there, you’d be burnt to a cinder very quickly.  And it breaks up these otherwise very \nstable [chlorofluorocarbon] molecules. \n \nAnd then you’ve got free radicals containing chlorine and fluorine, which undergo another \ncomplex chain of chemical events before finally they end up in the Antarctic lower \nstratosphere, and the Arctic as well – equally – but, in the Antarctic, conditions are generally \nMichael McIntyre Page 192 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n192 \ncolder, so you’ve got more of these polar stratospheric clouds, and so, more scope for \nheterogeneous chemistry.  And finally you’ve got to have the sunlight, to finish the whole \nthing off.  And that happens in the spring in the Antarctic, and that’s why the ozone hole \nsuddenly appears in the Antarctic spring.   \n \n[0:13:17] \n \nAnd so when was... I think you described the first flight there, didn’t you, through the ozone \nhole?  When was the flight which you took part in? \n \nOkay, so I was talking about the first airborne expedition to make these measurements.  \nWell, there was a second expedition, and I was on that.  That went to the Arctic, to see how \nmuch of the same sorts of things went on in the Arctic.  The answer was, we could see the \nbeginnings of them.  We could see definite signs of all the same things, but much less of \nthem, because the Antarctic, sorry, the Arctic – I’m talking about the Arctic – the Arctic lower \nstratosphere is usually not as cold as the Antarctic lower stratosphere.  But we learnt a lot of \nuseful stuff. \n \nI went along as a sort of consultant theoretician; and I don’t think I did an awful lot that’s \nscientifically significant beyond, you know, doing a bit of educating... educating the chemists \na bit about the sort of fluid dynamics, and why you’d expect the vortex core, which we spoke \nof last time – where you have the ozone hole in the Antarctic – the core of the stratospheric \npolar vortex is a... more or less isolated from its surroundings, so it can have its own \nchemistry.  So I talked a lot about that, and showed them some of the early computer \nsimulations from our group.  I suppose it may have had some influence.  And many of them \nweren’t surprised, because they’d seen observational evidence that supported the idea that \nthe vortex core was isolated. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 193 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n193 \nPeople who look at aerosols, so called, these are the usual aerosols – this again is a sort of \nhaze.  Most of the lower stratosphere has, all the time, a haze of sulphuric acid droplets.  \nThat comes mainly from volcanic eruptions, but there are other sources.  But that’s a stable \nspecies that hangs around, tiny droplets, only a few microns across.  Um... a few microns?  \nThey’re even smaller, many of them, a fraction of a micron.  Anyway, they’re small enough \n[that] they don’t settle out quickly.  So they hang around in the lower stratosphere.  And \npeople had been flying satellite instruments to observe these aerosols for quite a few years.  \nAnd when I started talking about the fluid dynamics of isolating the vortex core, they tended \nto say, oh yes, we knew that anyway because the aerosols are always different: they have a \ndifferent character inside the vortex than outside the vortex [core].   \n \nI think Joe Farman had noticed the isolation of it through the eruption of a particular volcano. \n \nYes, Joe was very much an observational scientist, so he was aware of all this.  Joe once told \nme that even Dobson, the pioneer of ozone observation in the, you know, first half of the \ntwentieth century... Dobson... pretty much worked out... I’m not quite sure how strong the \nevidence was, but Farman claimed that Dobson knew about the difference between the \nvortex core and the vortex exterior, from his ozone measurements.  And they used to... I \nmean, they recognised [intuitively – and we can now say correctly, with detailed justification] that \nthe fluid dynamics must be a bit like the classic fluid dynamics of smoke rings.  You see, it is \nfundamentally a similar phenomenon.  You blow a smoke ring – and in those days you saw \nthem all the time in college combination rooms, and everywhere [laughs].  And it goes back \nto Lord Kelvin.  Lord Kelvin would have been very familiar with smoke rings.  That’s why he \ngot interested in vortex dynamics.  That’s why he proved his circulation theorem that we’ve \nspoken of. \n \nIf you think of a smoke ring, it’s got a core that’s filled with smoke, and a surrounding that’s \nrelatively smoke-free, so that precisely illustrates this same thing.  The core tends to keep \nitself isolated, and the [Kelvin] circulation... the contour you choose, for the circulation of \nthat, is one that just surrounds the core, you see.  Kelvin worked out most of the theory of \nthose things... a very smart guy.  (He thought it was a key to understanding atoms.  He \nMichael McIntyre Page 194 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n194 \nthought atoms might actually be miniature vortex structures.  It was a brilliant idea, even \nthough it was wrong.  It was a marvellous idea.  You couldn’t do any better than that at the \ntime.  Didn’t have quantum mechanics, did we.) \n \n[0:17:33] \n \nWhat did you see on the flight? \n \nOh, well, I of course couldn’t go on the ER-2 since it’s a single seater, but I did go on the DC-8 \na couple of times.  In fact on both occasions it went to the North Pole – so I’ve been to the \nNorth Pole twice!  And on one of those occasions they flew around the North Pole at, I don’t \nknow, ninety-nine point something north, so they flew in a big circle around the pole, so we \nhad two Thursdays and two Fridays, you see.  So I made a bureaucratic joke: we should claim \ntwo extra days of expenses.  (The way bureaucrats sometimes behave, I sometimes think \nthey deserve that.)   But I don’t think anyone took up the suggestion [laughs].  Another \ninteresting thing was, I was allowed to go on the flight deck, as well as look at all the \ninstruments working.  And it was all fascinating stuff to me ’cause I’d never seen any of this \ndone, you know, lidars that looked up at the clouds, and things that measured chemicals [in \ntiny concentrations]. \n \nAnd on the flight deck I was interested of course in the navigational instruments.  And one \namusing thing was that the gyroscope, the inertial navigation system, worked perfectly fine \nall the way up to the pole; but another system called Omega, which is a radio location \nsystem based on longwave radio – it’s been around for ages and ages; it’s a very standard \ninstrument – when we got to about eighty-nine and a half north, it suddenly went crazy.  I \nthought, why on earth is this?  Long radio waves don’t know about the pole specially; they \nshould work just as well at the pole as anywhere else [laughs].  But then I realised, ah, must \nbe a programming bug.  The programmer didn’t realise that the ’plane would ever go to the \npole, and didn’t bother to look... y’know, take care of the possibility that the latitude might \nbe ninety degrees.  And then of course, you know... the cosine of ninety degrees vanishes.  \nMichael McIntyre Page 195 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n195 \nSo somewhere in the program I’m sure it must have divided by that, and they didn’t think \nabout, sort of, treating that as a special case.   \n \nAnd was it possible to look out of the window and see... anything... ? \n \nOh yes, oh yes.  It was an ordinary DC-8 so you could... you had a nice view out of the \nwindow, especially if you were on the flight deck.  And, well, we saw... well, I remember \nseeing some of the polar stratospheric clouds coming... let’s see.  Of course, we were in the \npolar night most of the time.  This was pretty much in the depths of winter, which is the \ninteresting time to observe.   But coming out of the polar night, or coming toward the dawn, \ncoming toward the edge of the polar night,    I remember seeing these polar stratospheric \nclouds, you know, layers of misty stuff, a peculiar brown colour if I remember correctly.  You \nknow, these are very small particles; they can do interesting optical things and make strange \ncolours – no trouble at all [laughs].  And I saw some auroras – beautiful coloured auroras, \nnear the pole.  They weren’t very big ones.  I don’t think it was a time of enormous solar \nactivity.  [On checking I find that, on the contrary, the Sun was fairly active at that time.  So probably \nit just wasn’t, then, sending too many particles out on paths intersecting the Earth .]  I suppose that’s \nabout all I saw, apart from sea below and so on [laughs] – or the sea ice, rather. \n \n[0:20:52] \n \nWas it useful to you, as someone who was investigating the air at this level, to see it?  You \nknow, was it in any way useful to someone who was thinking about it?   \n \nMm... well, er... strictly speaking, I... it probably didn’t make a huge difference to what I was \nable to do with the theory, but it probably... I mean, it was exciting.  And, well, as I said \nseveral times, I always admire the people who get it together to make these technically \ncomplicated observations: space-based, aircraft-based, there are other people who fly \nenormous balloons; there are all sorts of clever things they do.  And it takes an awful lot of \nMichael McIntyre Page 196 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n196 \npatience, ’cause the number of ways for these systems to go wrong is combinatorially large, \nand I always marvel when they work at all [laughs].  So I admire it, and love seeing and \nmeeting the people who do it, and chatting to them about their work and how they cope \nwith all the problems.  And seeing the instruments in operation is exciting. \n \nBut you might say that’s [just] cultural background really.  It kind of intensifies my interest – \nthat’s about everything.  Of course there were some more specific points, because these \nlidar instruments – lidar means a light-radar; it’s like radar: you shoot a light beam and you \nget echoes back and because the wavelength of light is much smaller than [that of] radio \nwaves, you can get echoes back off the cloud particles – and so you get rather good pictures \nof where the clouds are in the vortex.  And I remember one picture showing rather clearly \nthe sloping edge of the vortex, and the clouds inside and not outside.  And so in a way I \ncould say – well, surprise surprise – I know from the fluid dynamics that that kind of thing \nshould happen.  Nevertheless, it’s wonderful to see it. \n \nI mean, I would say the same thing about a picture on my website [home page at the string \n“gyroscopic pump in action”], which shows, from space-based observation – this was later \nwork from an instrument called CRISTA that flew on the space shuttle – but it shows the \nvortex and the breaking Rossby waves doing their thing, almost as clearly as you could see \non that weather-forecasting [movie] construction that I showed you yesterday.  You can see \nall that fluid dynamics going on for real, with no help, no model at all, just by looking at one \nof the chemical constituents in the stratosphere, which marks the – you know, it acts like a \ndye and marks the fluid motion – something called nitrous oxide.  And for me that’s very \nexciting, to see, for real, what had only been in my heated imagination, in the old days when \nI’d first worked with Tim Palmer and written my review article. \n \nDoes it help to convince you of the rightness of your work to see... to physically see in that \nway things that you’d sort of calculated or... you know... \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 197 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n197 \nI know what you mean.  Well, the answer’s, well, basically yes.  Anyone who cares about \ndoing good science wants as many crosschecks as possible, to boost one’s confidence that \none understands what’s going on.  And everything... you know, I looked at that picture on \nmy website when I first saw it with, well, slight trepidation.  It wasn’t much trepidation, \nbecause we’d done so much theoretical and numerical modelling by then we were very \nconfident we knew what was going on anyway.  Still, it is reassuring when you see the data \nfrom the raw observations of the real atmosphere actually showing the same thing, isn’t it?  \nSo you say, ah yes, yes – no surprise there – but it helps my confidence.   \n \nAnd what’s the role of it in convincing others? \n \nOh now, if you’re trying to give a lecture – it depends on the audience.  If it’s a lay audience \nyou have to try and spell out a lot of this stuff in a way you wouldn’t to a professional \ncolleague who knows it already.  Yes, you want to... I try to talk about the ways in which our \nconclusions have been checked.  I gave a lecture; I think you said you went to it – the, sort \nof, celebration of the discovery of the ozone hole – where I tried to do that sort of thing. \n \nIt’s quite difficult, in a talk that might only be twenty minutes or half an hour, to give the \nwhole story.  But you can give some sense of what sort of crosschecking has been done – \nyou know, I mean... in all the aspects.  I suppose... you know, we often, in my... I think many \nscientists do this – we often talk about a hierarchy of models, or a complex of models.  If you \nwant to understand anything that’s seriously complicated, like the Earth’s atmosphere, you \nreally do need some sort of hierarchy, at the top of which are the biggest computer models \nthat try to simulate everything at once. \n \nAnd as I said before, they fall short in many ways.  You can’t simulate everything at once – \nespecially if you’re trying to simulate the whole climate system.  But you can get some of the \ndetails quite well, and you can check them against observations; and that’s the exactly the \nsort of thing I’ve been talking about.  You can, you know, do a lot – you can simulate the \n[stratospheric ozone] chemistry quite well now, although it’s still only approximate – but again \nMichael McIntyre Page 198 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n198 \nyou can check it against observations.  So [with chemistry, fluid dynamics and radiation all \nincorporated] that’s the top end of the hierarchy of models; and that carries a heavy burden \nof direct comparison with observations. \n \nBut then you see various phenomena, such as the chemical isolation of the vortex core, and \nthe sharpening of the jet around it, and they’re all interconnected things.  So you try to \nmake, as it were, simplified models of those aspects, and that sort of thing’s been a lot of \nwhat I’ve done – and other theoretical fluid dynamicists.  I mean, quite a few people have \ndone stuff on this for quite a while now, of course.  So you take cases like that two-layer \nmodel that I showed in one of my talk slides, in which you can see a jet sharpening itself, and \nit’s actually a two-layer model that disturbs itself through what we call baroclinic instability.  \nThat’s the shear instability that I was talking about early on.  So you’ve isolated the \ninstability and jet-sharpening aspects, and you get a sense of how that works, because \nthere’s nothing else to complicate what’s going on.  And you can see that in that case you \ncan understand most of it in terms of the properties of potential vorticity – its mixability, its \ninvertibility – so that if you rearrange the potential vorticity, you inevitably rearrange \n[change, I should have said] the velocity profile, in a manner that’s anti-frictional.  You sharpen \nthe jet.  You do the opposite of what ordinary viscosity would do.  That’s why people call it \nanti-frictional, or negative viscosity – the opposite of what a domestic jet does when you try \nand blow out your [birthday] candles. \n \nSo that’s an example of an intermediate-level model.  It’s still quite complicated, because \nyou’ve got to take the fully-nonlinear fluid dynamics into account.  You’ve still got to rely on \na computer for a lot of it.  But then you use your theoretical knowledge to choose what to \nlook at.  And the potential-vorticity field is a good example of that. \n \nAnd then there are models that are still simpler:  I mentioned one yesterday, I think, the \n[Stewartson–Warn–Warn] Rossby-wave critical layer problem.  That’s a problem a lot of which \nyou can do purely on paper.  And that, again, shows the kind of interplay between Rossby-\nwave motion and Rossby-wave breaking that’s essential to all these problems.  But it shows \nMichael McIntyre Page 199 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n199 \nit in such a simple way [that] you can do most of the maths by hand.  So that’s another level \nof the hierarchy. \n \nAnd then, higher up, between the most comprehensive models and the sort of idealised \nmodels I’m talking about, there would be what people call simplified or ‘intermediate’ \ngeneral circulation models.  So they try to do the atmosphere on the whole sphere, and they \ntry to... but they simplify how the radiation and chemistry are represented.  There may be \nno chemistry at all.  And you might represent the radiation by a rather simplified heating and \ncooling function.  And when you do that... and by the way, the first time that was ever done \nwas by Norman Phillips.  I’ve mentioned him.  He was one of my postdoctoral mentors at \nMIT.  And that was a great piece of pioneering ’cause to do anything like that on the \ncomputers then available [the mid-1950s] was a pretty tall order.  And the hard labour of \ncoding everything in machine code, in assem… [assembly language or symbolic machine code, I \nstarted to say], and so on. \n \nSo… but now that’s the kind of tool that many people use: most research groups working on \nglobal-scale atmospheric dynamics will have simplified general circulation models at this \nintermediate level.  And you can study things like, how do the tropics and the extratropics \ninteract.  You can begin to get a handle on what effect would the... you know, an El Niño \ncycle have on the extratropical weather. \n \nWould it have anything to do with our recent severe winters, for example?   Some people \nthink they’ve shown that that is the case – if it’s the right sort of El Niño, you know.  There \nare subtleties: there’s a... several sorts of El Niños, depending on the sea-surface \ntemperature pattern.  And in an intermediate model you would probably not try to simulate \nthe ocean actively; you would just prescribe the sea-surface temperature, and see how the \natmosphere responds.  So you’re doing a thought-experiment where you’re isolating half of \nthe mechanism, in order to understand it better. \n \n[0:30:37] \nMichael McIntyre Page 200 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n200 \n \nIn the... when... you can imagine that when NASA switched on the bit of their satellite that \nallowed them to actually produce an image showing the ozone hole, that that was quite a \nconvincing image if you were going to say to people of all sorts of different kinds that there is \nan ozone hole.  And when Joseph Farman was talking about the Nature paper that he \npublished in 1985, he was telling me about decisions he made in displaying the graph.  And \nthe way in which he constructed the graph was to try and make it very clear what was going \non.  I think he said something like, I call it the grandma question, you know, will grandma \nunderstand it.  So... making the graph look visually clear, if you like. \n \nVery important. \n \nYes.  And I was wondering whether, in a similar way, depending on the audience you’re \ntalking to, do you make your arguments using different kinds of display?  So for example, if \nyou’re talking to fellow mathematicians, might it be more convincing to... simply use the \nequations, or the theory, or the thinking, whereas if you were talking, perhaps, to a student, \nare you more likely to use visualisation?  If you’re talking to a lay audience are you more \nlikely to show something...  So really I’m asking about how you go about convincing others \nwhat you may know in a certain way that you’re attempting to... convince them that this is \nright. \n \nWell, I try, of course, to discover ways of showing things that are most likely to be \nunderstood by different audiences.  Professional colleagues... they’re familiar with \nequations, so I’ll use equations – as well as pictures.  I always feel I don’t understand \nanything unless I’ve at least got equations and pictures that agree with each other – words \ntoo if possible – which is always difficult ’cause human language is fraught with built-in \ncontradictions.  So… and people like James Lighthill – I mentioned him before – he’s another \nof my heroes.  He was a great artist at using words, pictures and equations and making the \nwhole thing into a coherent, self-consistent picture.  That’s the approach I’d use for my \nprofessional colleagues. \nMichael McIntyre Page 201 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n201 \n \nFor a lay audience, of course, you can’t use equations, on the whole – maybe a very, very \nsimple one.  I mean, if I had  E = mc2  [or something equally simple]  I might… if I had something \nlike that, I might show that.  But I wouldn’t make a big deal of it, because people do get \nfrightened by equations.  They kind of switch off straight away. \nBut everyone has powerful vision, pretty much.  Human vision is the most amazing… \namazing, miraculous and powerful system.  And so I use that as best I can.  And as Joe said, \nworking out the right sort of graph, or whatever, is terribly important.  There are so many \nchoices; and some work better than others. \n \nIt might be a graph; it might be a geometric picture showing the shape of something.  In \nmy…  In the sort of fluid dynamics I’m talking about, potential-vorticity maps [and movies, \nanimated maps] are always central because, not only do they contain nearly all the dynamical \ninformation, but they’re also easy to understand [and make visual sense of] because, to a first \napproximation, different values of the potential vorticity are... [they] move, go with the fluid.  \nIt’s a material invariant.  It’s... um... so, if you give [different] colours for different values, it \nbehaves like a dye.  And that is much easier to understand than most things in science.  So I \ntry and take advantage of that. \n \n[0:34:27] \n \nThank you.  Are you able to tell us more about your relations with Joseph Farman either at \nthe time of the ozone-hole work, or before, if these relation started before, what you \nremember of, you know, knowing him personally?   \n \nIt’s a good question.  When did I get to know Joe?  I think the answer is a bit boring because, \nyou know, I was working away at the fluid dynamics, he was working away at the \nobservations, and there wasn’t any special reason for us to meet [at first].  I did meet him by \nchance, I vaguely remember, long before the ozone hole.  I mean, we did have contacts with \nMichael McIntyre Page 202 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n202 \nthe British Antarctic Survey for one reason or another.  This is going rather back in the mists \nof time. \n \nThat’s okay. \n \nBut Joe...  I think... well, Joe, you know... well, I’m sure you realise from the review [the \ninterview],  he’s a bit of a maverick and, sort of, has lots of bees in his bonnets – [evcn] more \nthan me perhaps – and is happy to talk about them to anyone who’ll listen.  I remember him \nholding forth on something or other; and I think it was about something meteorological.  It \nmight have been about the final warming, the Antarctic [stratospheric] warming or... \nsomething where, you know, you observe from the weather maps some of what happens...  I \ndon’t remember much more, because it didn’t really connect especially strongly with things I \nwas doing at the time.  And he didn’t know much about the fluid-dynamical theory, so there \nwasn’t much point in talking in detail about that.  It would have been a bit of... outside what \nhe was interested in then. \n \nBut then of course, after the ozone hole business... the whole thing became a hot topic and \nthere was much more interdisciplinary collaboration.  Then, naturally, I’d run into him at \nmeetings now and again, or here [in Cambridge] and, you know, have a chat about how things \nwere going.  I mean, he would tell me how the Montreal Protocol was going.  He was more \nclosely involved in the thing... er, the politics and bureaucracy of that.  And that was a \nterribly important thing to do.  I have to say, he often came over rather pessimistically.  He \ntended to be impatient with the ponderousness, and the imperfection, of the politics and \nbureaucracy and, you know, “if people had any sense they’d do this and that,” he would \ntend to say irritably [laughs]. \n \nAnd, you know, when we think about the climate problem, I think most of us would tend to \nbe irritable.  The money involved is so much bigger, the political difficulties are so much \nbigger.  The problem is so much bigger.  It’s very difficult to know what to do until nature \nshows us clearly enough that we’ve [human societies have] been making a big mistake. \nMichael McIntyre Page 203 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n203 \n \n[0:37:17] \n \nTo what extent have you been involved in the IPCC process, which... ? \n \nI’ve never been in that.  I know [some of those involved]... some of my best friends are IPCC \nscientists [laughs].  [The work is mostly voluntary, by the way – IPCC is a lot of hard work, mostly \nunpaid.]  And, as I think I said before, I enormously admire those of them that I know.  And I \nabsolutely resent the disinformers’ campaign to discredit them and to paint them as \ndishonest.  You know, there’s two kinds of sceptics in this world.  There are honest scientists, \nwho must be honest sceptics.  You wouldn’t be a scientist if you weren’t a sceptic and always \nasked, “is my idea... does it stand up... does it stack up against the evidence?” – but \nconsidered honestly. \n \nThen there are... many of the climate ‘sceptics’... some are honest sceptics and just, I would \nclaim, deluded; they haven’t seen [or considered] some of the key evidence – for instance, \ncarbon dioxide in ice cores – and thought about the implications of that [laughs].  Others, I \nwould claim, are dishonest sceptics.  The word [sceptic] has been hijacked by anyone who is \nbeing highly paid to discredit climate science.  I think it’s pretty obvious that that’s going on.  \nAnd the big money is not in scientific hands.  The big money is in the hands of hedge-fund \nmanagers, bankers and all these people; and not all of them specially want climate scientists \nto be heard, do they?  It puts... they can’t carry on with their business as usual and being fat \ncats, can they?   \n \n[0:38:50] \n \nWhy is that you haven’t been involved in it, that your friends have but you... ? \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 204 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n204 \nWell... erm... two reasons, I suppose.  One is I’m not specially in the [big] modelling business.  \nIPCC, of necessity, has to focus on the big models.  That’s of course one of its problems, \nbecause of the big models’ imperfections.  But we can’t do any better; we have to try with \nthese models.  We have to try and make them better.  There’s a huge labour in doing that, \n’cause these models are... they’re not as complex as the Earth system, but, by golly, they are \ncomplex.  They’re much too complex for a single person to understand the entire code; so \nyou’ve got to have big teams of people that are responsible for different parts of the code. \n \nAnd I’ve never been in that business, (a) because I’m not specially good at computer \nprogramming; I tend to make too many mistakes.  [Sorry, long digression for the rest of this \nparagraph:]   Anybody who’s ever programmed a computer knows how easy it is, you know \n[to make programming mistakes]: you count something wrong, you do something one too \nmany times, or whatever.  It’s very hard to get absolutely everything right.  It’s another case \nwhere the number of ways to go wrong is combinatorially large.  (That’s one reason, by the \nway, why government IT projects usually fall into the sand, and come in ten times over \nbudget, and all of that, because politicians don’t understand combinatorial largeness – the \nnumber of ways to go wrong – the sheer consequences of having an idea in the bath and \nsaying, oh, let’s do this system another way.  Of course they’re always doing that, because \nthe political time horizon is so short, and they don’t realise that changing the spec of... \ny’know... the NHS IT system is a good example [laughs]... it’s going to make... add years and \nyears of struggle to get it right.  And the teams may have almost got it right, when suddenly \nthey [the politicians] change their mind, and you’ve got to throw a lot of it out, and start \nagain.)   But I mean, even getting a complex computer system right when you’ve got clear \nspecifications, and no political interference – that’s hard enough, for heaven’s sake.  So \nanyway, that’s not particularly a gift of mine, to be good at that. \n \n[And (b)]  the other thing I’m not specially good at is teamwork.  Being a bit of a maverick, I \nwasn’t ever a very good manager, beyond encouraging the young people to, you know, be \ncreative themselves – which of course is successful with some of them.  So... and, you know, \nit’s well known that if you get McIntyre involved in some team, the chances are he’ll fail to \nmeet some deadline for getting something written [just as I’ve taken a small age to check and \ncorrect this transcript].  And that’s no good in an operation like IPCC, is it? \nMichael McIntyre Page 205 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n205 \n \nBut in a way it gives me a natural advantage, because I can, sort of, be a more dispassionate \nobserver of what goes on, and I can think in a scientifically independent way, and I can make \njudgements about what makes sense and what doesn’t. \n \nAnd this is one reason why I’m banging on a bit about paying more attention to the \npaleo[climate] record.  I’m not the only one.  I mean, that is getting into IPCC.  I’ve been \nbending the ears of everyone I know in IPCC [for what it’s worth]: for God’s sake, expand the \ntime horizon – start talking about what happens to the Earth system for many centuries or \nmillennia – because it’s very illuminating to understand what happens then.  You have to \nbring in the whole carbon cycle, and all of that, which is too complex to model accurately, \nbut whose gross properties we know very well from these ice-core records.   \n \nI’m very interested in why it... why the paleoclimate work hasn’t had the status within the \nIPCC.  In other words, why it’s necessary for you to bend the ear of these people. \n \nHmm, well, you know, there’s a political imperative [combined with practical limitations].  I \nmean, they started with what seemed a perfectly reasonable aim.  We can hardly hope to \npredict further ahead than one century [it seemed reasonable to say]; so one century is \nsomething that’s kind of a neat marker that you can grasp; so let’s try and predict a century \nahead.  And you could even say, well, it doesn’t much matter projecting further ahead [than \na century] because you can’t possibly plan for that, anyway. \n \nBut then again, you see, my answer is, well, in the case of the climate system, that’s perhaps \nnot enough, because if, as is likely [in my judgement], the Earth system is already on its way \ntowards an Eocene-like state [far hotter than today, with no great ice sheets], it may take \nmany centuries, or even a few millennia, to get there.  That depends on ice-flow dynamics, \nand storm-track dynamics and snow accumulation, and we don’t model any of those things \nwell enough.  But the sort of timescale it might take is certainly multi-century or more. \nMichael McIntyre Page 206 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n206 \n \nAnd it gives you an insight that I think does inform the debate, because if the models are \neven roughly right – and the projections of sea-level rise are roughly right – once the sea \nstarts rising there’s a pretty high chance that it’ll keep on rising, unstoppably, for very many \ncenturies, until it’s very many metres.  I mean, the potential is something like seventy or \neighty metres high[er], just from melting the great ice sheets.  So the one metre at the end \nof the century is, in a way, a pretty small part of the story.  [I said “unstoppably”, but that could \nchange once carbon-capture technologies are taken seriously – including air capture, for which there \nare other good reasons, including mitigation of ocean food-chain disasters from ocean acidification.] \n \nSo, although you can’t really make detailed projections of this, ’cause you don’t know the \nrates – the precise rates at which all these things are happening – you could say there’s a \ncertain [very high] confidence about the sort of thing that will, sooner or later, happen.  And \nthat should [in my opinion] be part of the background to this debate – and a good answer to \npeople who say, well, you know, climate change is so uncertain that it’s not a problem [and] \nwe should just carry on with Business as Usual. \n \n[0:44:34] \n \nYou know, [the eminent economist] Lord Stern wrote this report on... what’s it called, Blueprint \nfor a Safer Planet.  There was a report, and then there was a book – a sort of second edition \nof it in the form of a book.  And he argues that if we were to take all this seriously, people \ncould make money.  But he’s not the only one, by the way.  Richard Branson agrees.  Richard \nBranson’s a smart guy as well as a business tycoon.  He started something called the Carbon \nWar Room – which you can easily find on the web – and its message is, look, climate change \nis a serious problem and, look, if you’re a business entrepreneur, it’s a jolly good chance to \nmake money.  It allows you to see further ahead than your competitors, just spot the... you \nknow, the low-hanging fruit – how we can move toward a low-carbon economy – and you’ll \nmake your fortune.  And that may be the way that we eventually do a bit of mitigation. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 207 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n207 \nI can’t see it happening through politics.  Politicians think in far too short-term a way. \n \n[0:45:36] \n \nHas there been any effect of... the kinds of scientists who were those involved in setting up \nthe IPCC, has that had an effect on the relative exclusion of paleoclimate studies from it? \n \nOh, I think it’s more [a matter of unavailability than exclusion]... I mean, the people involved, \nsome of them are very high quality thinkers [who wouldn’t have tried to exclude any relevant \ninformation].  I mean, Sir John Houghton is an example.  I’ve known him for a long time, ever \nsince he was the leader of the group at Oxford that pioneered some of the kinds of infrared \nsensing of the stratosphere, so I had a professional involvement with their work.  Houghton \nwas really... I think he was the founder chairperson of IPCC [yes, back in 1988].  But, look, the \nanswer to your question is that... everybody... well, there are two answers really. \n \nOne is that, when IPCC started, the paleo record wasn’t so clear.  I mean, people have \nlaboured mightily to refine the time resolution [and to increase greatly the number of lines of \nevidence].  This business of the Dansgaard-Oeschger warming events, you know, in the \nQuaternary time, they... the fact that they’re so fast that they... you can get significant \nclimate change within one individual’s lifetime.  That wasn’t known then [in 1988] because, \nyou know, you’re faced with this ice core, or mud core or whatever it is, and you’ve got to \nget all the little shells out, or analyse the chemistry of the air bubbles, and...  It’s a huge \nlabour to do any of that; and so of course they did it with coarser time resolution at first.  \nYou know, multi-century [at best].  So getting down to decadal times was a huge amount of \nwork; and that’s only been available in, oh, I don’t know, the last ten years or so probably.  \nSo when Sir John Houghton started IPCC, he wouldn’t have known quite how vivid that \nrecord... how very insightful it was going to be.  I don’t think even the ice-core CO2 \nmeasurements... they weren’t... I think they were beginning, but I don’t think we knew an \nawful lot about that, back then. \nMichael McIntyre Page 208 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n208 \n \nSo [and this is the second answer] there wasn’t anything else they could do other than say, let’s \ntry and build the best climate models we can, and do the best predictions we can [restricted \nto a century ahead], and be very honest about the uncertainties.  And they always were.  \nThere’s always been a large range of uncertainty.  And that’s in itself such a huge task [the \nmodel-building and the assessment against recent and contemporary observations], they wouldn’t \nhave had the time or energy to do anything else. \n \n[0:47:56] \n \nAnd could you tell me about your work with John Houghton’s group, because John Houghton \nis one of the other interviewees on this project.   \n \nYes. \n \nAnd so he’s told me about his work in developing the satellite instruments.  But it would be \nnice to see it all from your point of view, as well as from his. \n \nWell, my involvement... I mean, I didn’t ever have a collaborative project, not at that time \nanyway.  But since I was getting interested in stratospheric dynamics, I naturally paid \nattention to their results, ’cause they were direct observations.  In fact, if you look at the \nNature paper by Palmer and myself you... I think the opening line, almost, is [that, thanks to \nthe satellite instruments] “the stratosphere is a wonderful outdoor laboratory, where nature \ndoes great fluid-dynamical experiments, from which we have much to learn.”  Those weren’t \nthe exact words.  But that was because of this remote-sensing business that was pioneered \nat... a lot of it was pioneered at Oxford [starting in the late 1960s].  There were some American \ngroups doing similar things at the time.  I recall that the Oxford group got ahead... with the \nMichael McIntyre Page 209 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n209 \ninfrared sensing of the stratosphere ’cause they thought of this rather clever trick of the gas \ncell. \n \n’Cause everybody knew that what you had to do was look at the infrared coming off the CO2 \nand later on other chemical [species]... other greenhouse gases, but CO2 was sort of the \nstrongest one.  And if you look at the spectrum of wavelengths that come off, it’s incredibly \ncomplicated.  You know, you’ve got this graph that looks like fur, you know, all the peaks and \nvalleys of adjacent wavelengths being more, or less, strongly interacting with the CO2 \nmolecule.  And to understand all of that, you’ve got to do the full quantum mechanics and \nit’s quite complicated.  But... to measure that, you see... You see, one thing it means is the \nfollowing, that if you look at wavelengths where the CO2  is... less... [or] is more opaque – \nwhere it strongly interacts with the infrared photons – you... the whole atmosphere looks \nopaque, so you see the top of... you see the upper layers.  If you look at the opposite \nextreme, where the CO2  is more transparent, then you see deeper.  Now if you can organise \n[observations at] a number of wavelengths, you can get vertical profiles of things [such as \ntemperature] – which is very clever to start with.  But what the Oxford group did, and at the \ntime I think it was the brightest idea anyone could have, is that they said, let’s use CO2  gas \nitself as the filter. \n \nAnd so they had a cell with CO2 gas in it, so its spectrum matched exactly that of the infrared \ncoming off.  But then they used technical tricks like pressure modulation – now here I’m \ngetting a bit at the fringe of my knowledge.  But you’ve got to somehow vary the properties \nof the absorbing cell so that it sees to different depths; but they managed to do that.  And \n[laughs] so that was, I think, a first for them, making that technique work [the gas cell \ntechnique, in one form or another].  I think, these days, optical filters and sensors and, you \nknow, purely artificially-constructed things do pretty well, as well, because the computing \npower is so much bigger; the resolution of everything is so much better.  So I’m not actually \nsure whether they still use gas cells.  You might find if you looked into it that they use a \ncombination of that and sophisticated sensors.  [On checking, I find that gas cells are indeed still \nused, filled with whatever trace gas is being observed in the atmosphere.  The technical term is ‘gas \ncorrelation radiometry’.] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 210 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n210 \nBut, you know, it’s a huge... it’s a very high-technological art now.  I mean, this CRISTA \ninstrument that I mentioned, that can see in remarkable detail [with high spatial resolution] – it \ncan even see breaking Rossby waves in the real stratosphere.  That’s, you know, a later \ndevelopment of that sort of technology, but I’ve forgotten exactly whether they use gas cells \nor just sensors.  What I do know is that it’s a helium-cooled instrument.  It’s the same sort of \ntechnology that was used to... that... cosmologists used to sense the microwave background \nof the universe.  You’ve got to have a very cold detector ’cause otherwise the local thermal \nfluctuations overwhelm your signal.  So they’ve applied that sort of thing to sensing the \nstratosphere, and got much more sensitivity and much more resolution and everything.  \nThat’s why we can see the breaking Rossby waves now. \n \nTo what extent was your and Tim Palmer’s blurred view of the stratosphere dependent on \nthis CO2  cell in the radiometer? \n \nOh well, that was... our Nature paper was 1983, and the Oxford group was... I think they \nwere beginning to get results in the... well the second half of the 1970s, if I recall.  [Wrong!  \nOxford’s first remote-sensing instrument flew much earlier, in 1970, on the Nimbus 4 satellite.  And \nthe first results were reported in Nature the same year.]  So those results had been around.  And \nas I mentioned yesterday, there were also operational meteorological satellites, which were \nactually the ones [TIROS-N] that Tim and I used because that’s... the Met Office had the data \nfrom those.  [And, to answer the question, I find on checking that the TIROS-N instruments did use \ngas cells and indeed were, technically, direct descendents of the original Oxford instruments .] \n \n[0:53:13] \n \nYou know, in those days – this is an aside, but an important one – in those days quite a lot of \nthe meteorological data were proprietary.  You couldn’t get hold of it without either working \nin that place or buying it.  And, you know, the whole climate-science community has been in \nterrible trouble recently because of data not being open-access.  And I think now there’s a \nbig push to make everything open-access – the way John Sulston did with the genome data – \nMichael McIntyre Page 211 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n211 \nwhich at first sight sounds like a bad business plan, but actually on second thoughts works \nbetter, because then things can’t be grabbed by the corporate world  [restricting and inhibiting \nresearch on, e.g., the hugely complex, and poorly-understood, causes of cancer]. \n \nAnd the same goes for meteorological data.   You know, there’s money to be made with \nmeteorological data.  Some people want to keep it private.  But then it opens the way for \nthe climate ‘sceptics’ to accuse people of hiding things.  And we now know, that’s \ncompletely unacceptable.  Everybody must make their data open-access.  So that’s another \nchange, today as distinct from there [then]. \n \nSo where you were asking about the satellite data that we based our work on, well, that was \nthe TIROS[-N] operational satellite but the technology was a similar... it was certainly an \ninfrared sensor.  Whether they used gas cells or not... I really... I don’t think I ever knew.   So \nthere you are.  As a humble theoretician I don’t... I’m not familiar with everything about the \nobserving techniques.  [But as noted above, I do know, now, that the TIROS-N instruments did use \ngas cells.] \n \n[0:54:38] \n \nNow one of the things that’s well known about John Houghton is that his faith is very strong, \nand he draws links between his faith and science very openly and very clearly.  I wondered \nhow apparent that was when you knew him, at the time that he was working on these \nthings.   \n \nWhen I first knew John I didn’t know he was a devout Christian.  I learnt that later.  In fact, [it \nwas when] I once heard his very familiar voice on the Sunday... whatever it is on Sunday \nmorning on Radio 4.  They have a religious news programme.  And suddenly there was this \nfamiliar voice saying, “Look, God calls on us to be good stewards for the Earth.”  I said, \n“Good for you”.  You know, I mean, I don’t know whether I... I don’t know whether you want \nMichael McIntyre Page 212 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n212 \nto ask me about my, sort, of personal convictions.  I’m not specially religious.  I’d call myself \na... I told you before, I did go to Quaker meetings as a young person, but it never quite did as \nmuch for me as, for example, music.  I think I went mainly ’cause I knew some very \nwonderful people who were Quakers, marvellous people.  I do admire the Quaker \nmovement.  It’s just that their particular rituals and way of worship didn’t really give me \nenough spiritual solace to be worth… to… well, you have to devote a lot of time and energy \nto it, of course. \n \nI’d call myself a ‘reverent agnostic’.  I strongly disagree with people like Richard Dawkins \n[and, even more, Peter Atkins].  I have to say this.  Dawkins is a brilliant thinker and \ncommunicator, and teaches us a lot about the biological world, most of which I buy.  I mean, \nI’m not a professional biologist, but a lot of it makes... I think I know how to think \nscientifically, and a lot of it does make sense [to me].  I’m aware, of course, as with all \nscience, that our knowledge is incomplete.  But there’s Dawkins saying he knows for sure \nthat God doesn’t exist.  Now to me that’s just another fundamentalist  belief system.  If you \n‘know’ an absolute ‘truth’ that bears no contradiction – then you’re just being like an \nayatollah [a fundamentalist one] or an American religious-right  [and in this regard you’re not a \nscientist, I’d argue] or... look, it doesn’t matter what the particular religion is, it’s the same \nsort of extremism. \n \nAnd I’m sure Richard would be horrified if he heard me insinuating that he was an extremist \n[laughs].  But in one... in this one regard, I am critical.  Because I don’t see how he can be \nsure that God doesn’t exist – or something like God – God in some interpretation or another.  \nI mean, he’s probably thinking of the naïve, you know, Biblical – an old man with the beard, \nin the sky, and so on.  He’s probably thinking of something like that.  And I would more or \nless agree but I would reply, how do you know there isn’t some reality behind  this thing?  \nAnd... what  I come down to in the end is saying, okay, I don’t really think there’s an entity in \nthe sky.  I think the whole thing is much more likely in genetic memory, that we have... if you \nlike, a gift, or an ability, or a propensity – for some of us at least – to believe in [and \nexperience] such a thing; and it’s very important for human societies, because it’s very \nimportant for some people to stay hopeful [in this particular way] – and staying hopeful is \nterribly important to all of us – whether or not we’re believers. \nMichael McIntyre Page 213 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n213 \n \nSo I’m... I suppose my position is quite close to Martin Rees’s.  He explains it very well, in his \nbrilliantly lucid way.  I’m not religious myself, but I’m not critical of people who are religious \n– especially if they don’t insist that I believe what they believe – if they’re not \nfundamentalist.  If they have a personal experience of spiritual solace, of being part of \nsomething larger than themselves that inspires them and gives them hope, I’m all in favour \nof it.  You know, good for them, I say.  And I’ve met people of whom that’s true, and they’re \nwonderful people. \n \nDo you have any sort of view on why there’s... why there is something rather than nothing \nthough, why... ? \n \nOh well, now that’s... now we’re getting into the multiverse, aren’t we?  I mean [laughs]...  \nWhy there’s something rather than nothing?  It’s a rather Hegelian philosophical question, I \nthink [laughs].  I have to say, I regard questions like that as uninteresting, because there isn’t \na hope of giving a coherent answer.  I would just start from saying, we are here, things are as \nthey are.  What’s interesting to me is to understand how things work – which includes how \nhuman psychology works, incidentally, and why it was naturally selected [for], to work the \nway it does.  And I think you can get quite a lot of insight about that.  And that includes \nreligious belief.   \n \n[0:59:23] \n \nYes, we’ll come back to that when we talk about your recent writings on lucidity and science, \nwhich is a key part of that, I think, isn’t it?  And I know that you’ll be able to say that this \ndeveloped throughout your career, the thinking behind that. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 214 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n214 \nVery gradually, yes.  As I say, going back to proofreading George Batchelor’s great textbook \non fluid dynamics  [and even further back, perhaps, to Pickles walking ‘through’ the bars].  And \nthere are parts of that [Batchelor’s textbook]  I know are free of typos [laughs].  Erm... and... \nnoticing that lucid writing [Batchelor’s for instance, and Lord Rayleigh’s] uses repetition – \njudiciously!  There’s a distinction between repetition and repetitiousness, isn’t there?  \nThere’s such a thing as overdoing repetition.  But it’s equally ridiculous to avoid it \ncompletely, because what we’re sensitive to is organic change, and so, very often, the \ninvariant element in an organically-changing pattern of words is something like a repeated \nnoun.  “We will be serious if you are serious.”  That’s a stronger sentence than “We will be \nserious if you are.”   The repeated “serious” adds strength and lucidity.  [And conversely, if you \nwant to make it weak and muddy, just go with “the minor novelists and the reporters” – to quote \nH.W. Fowler – and use gratuitous or pointless variation: “We will be serious if you are not frivolous.” ] \n \nWell, perhaps now is the time then for you to say how you think this early interest, which \nyou... I think you said you think begins editing George Batchelor’s... \n \nOnly proofreading. \n \nProofreading George Batchelor’s work – how this interest in lucidity developed through your \ncareer to the point where, recently, you’ve been writing three major papers on it – in a series \nof three which are available on the website. \n \nOh, I think I can answer that easily.  Having noticed one or two techniques of lucid writing, \nquite early on, of course I was interested.   Because I had an urge... I thought I’d discovered \nsome interesting things, like the ‘upstream influence’ or whatever it was – anything in the \nearly papers.  Why would I bother to write those big papers if I weren’t intensely interested \nin having understood something?  Well... after that, you want to communicate it to others.  I \nfound that what I was best at was getting it clear in the written form.  I always had a \nproblem being clear [when] speaking  [as this interview well illustrates!]  because one of the \nthings about good writing – strong writing, lucid writing – is omitting the needless words; \nMichael McIntyre Page 215 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n215 \nbut when you’re speaking, if you utter a needless word – as I’ve done quite often in this \ninterview – there’s nothing you can do about it [laughs]. \n \nSo... let’s see...  So... the interest in these techniques grew gradually, and I had the struggle \nof trying to write my papers, and gradually getting a bit better at it.  I was lucky that I noticed \nnot to be afraid of repetition, at an early stage.  That saved a lot of bother.  But then of \ncourse I started taking on more and more research students – graduate students or \nwhatever you call them these days [laughs] – and of course you have to read their thesis \ndrafts.  And I began to notice that the, you know, errors of the novice tended to be... there \nused to be, well, there were a number that were always the same.  One of them was \navoiding repetition, and a few other things like that – not being sufficiently aware of how \nword-patterns work.  And so I gradually got bored with writing the same comments in these \ndrafts, so I decided I... there’s some... you know, and I suppose... let’s see...  Another \ningredient of this was becoming interested in perception psychology. \n \nNow I can’t quite get the chronology of that, but I remember a wonderful book by Richard \nGregory, that lovely man who’s very well known for his work on perception psychology.  This \nbook is called The Intelligent Eye.  This came out quite a while ago [1970].  I probably read it, I \ndon’t know, quite early in my career.  And it was making a very interesting point, which is... \nwell, how I now express it is to say that “perception works by model-fitting.”  He talks about \n‘object hypotheses’ – but he meant the internal mental models that are [actively but \nunconsciously] fitted to the incoming data from your eyes, or ears, or whatever.  [And ‘models’ \nare, of course, partial and approximate representations of reality – whether expressed in equations, \npictures, computer codes, neural firing patterns, or in any other way.]  There are very often many \n[data] sources – touch, hearing, seeing.  All those data are being fitted to internal models, \n’cause when you see, hear, or touch something and you think, er...  “Ha, that’s a stapling \nmachine” – see, I’m sensing it in... all the ways I’m talking about [makes clicking noises with \nstapler]... different things it’s made of...  I’m... what the subjective experience is, I see a \nstapler here – I see, hear, and feel a stapler – but the only way I can do that is that this \ninternal mental model is fitting all those data.  The perceived reality is the internal model. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 216 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n216 \nOnce you understand that, you understand a whole lot of other interesting things – such as \nwhy there can be such things as hallucinations.  Why, if I were in a certain mental state, \nperhaps drug-induced, might I see the Devil with all his horns sitting on that chair, with every \nwhisker perfectly real?  People have experiences like that.  I haven’t actually had any such \nvivid experience, but they’re often reported, aren’t they?  People with schizophrenia hear \nvoices.  And those voices are perfectly real.  Okay – so the perceived reality is the internal \nmodel. \n \nOnce you understand that you understand a whole lot of things about how perception works \nand – because I was always interested in music – I began to understand a lot of things about \nhow music works, as well.  [That’s, of course, how they got the whole orchestra into that “thin little disc”!]  \nAnd that, naturally, spun off into how strong writing works.  And that’s how the Lucidity \npapers originated.  I wanted to try and put down a coherent account of all this, in a way that \nwould interest a young scientist – my students in particular [laughs] – so that they wouldn’t \nkeep boring me with these drafts that kept making the same mistakes. \n \nYou know, one of the most brilliant students I ever had – he’s one of the two or three best; I \nclass him with Jim Woodhouse and one or two others – his name was Rupert Ford.  He died \ntragically, actually, that was a terrible thing – just when he was getting launched into a \nmeteoric scientific career.  And Rupert was very smart.  And, you know, he was one of those \n[rare] students with whom one tended to feel early on that he was supervising me, rather \nthan the reverse.  You know, I couldn’t get anything past him without having a jolly strong \nargument for it [laughs].  And it was very stimulating. \n \nAnd I remember Rupert presenting me with a draft of one of his early bits of writing, and I \nsaw he was making some of these novice mistakes – including avoiding repetition.  [Another \nwas not being about twice as explicit as he felt necessary.]  And you see, when you’re young and \nvery smart, you always [tend to] make this [kind of] mistake.  You don’t want to insult the \nsenior person’s intelligence, do you?  You don’t want to make things too obvious.  To which \nthe reply is: no, you want to make things very obvious and trivial.  And... remind me to tell \nyou the story of the Adams–Airy Affair; that’s one of Littlewood’s stories. \nMichael McIntyre Page 217 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n217 \n \nBut anyway, I pointed... I got Rupert to read... I think it was just Part I of Lucidity and Science, \nwhich I think I had a draft of by then.  This was the early ‘90s.  Yeah, I probably had an early \ndraft of that.  And I said, “Read that and take it in, and then have a go at rewriting your \ndraft.”  Next day, ping [snaps fingers], suddenly it was lucid.  The penny dropped \nimmediately, with him.  He could see the point, and he knew what to do with the draft.  I \ndidn’t write any detailed comments at all [laughs].  So that was a great joy.  And, you know, \nfrom time to time I meet people who say they find it helpful. \n \n[1:07:14] \nHas undergraduate teaching had any effect on the development of these interests? \n \nWell, of course, the task of having to give lectures... and I wasn’t naturally good at that \nbecause, as I say, I’m better at writing, when you have a chance to redraft things.  But, you \nknow, I gradually learnt to give a moderately decent lecture [laughs].  I ended up... I mean, \nthere were incidental reasons.  As well as not being instantly clear what to say next, I tended \nto make mistakes on the blackboard as well, so I had to proofread my blackboard writing, \nwhich was all a bit of a... a bit tedious for all concerned.  And the students are never quick to \npoint out mistakes on a blackboard, so sometimes you get into quite a tangle.  So I ended up \nalways producing printed handout notes. \n \nAnd by the time I got to that point, I think I was quite successful as a lecturer.  In fact on my \nwebsite you’ll see some notes on group theory that I’m quite proud of, ’cause that... it was \nan aspect of group theory that’s quite difficult to get clear.  [It’s called ‘representation \ntheory’.]  And I inherited some very complicated lecture notes written by experts.  In a way...  \nYou see, I’m not an expert on group theory but, in a way, it’s better to lecture on something \nyou’re not an expert on ’cause then you see it more like the students do.  So I was able, I \nthink, to produce a much more lucid version of those notes, which is still on my webpage, in \ncase anyone’s interested [laughs]. \nMichael McIntyre Page 218 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n218 \n \nAnd what I did in the lectures was hand out the notes for that lecture, and put a copy up on \nthe overhead projector, and have a pointer on the bit I was talking about.  So there was no \ndoubt... nobody was hunting around to see where I was.  (There’s always this danger when \nyou’ve got a lot of stuff in front of you, you don’t quite know where to look.)  So I was always \npointing to where they should look and I was... the lecture consisted of highlighting the \nhighlights [aurally and visually, at the same time] – underlining the key bits of it that they \nshould not miss.  And probably the students taking notes... most of them, I think, would \nhave underlined the same bit.  And I think that would have been helpful to them after the \nlecture. \n \nHow do you feel that your verbal performance or, you know, the more performative aspects \nof it improved?  One of the things you’ve said is that you produced lucid handouts, instead of \ntrying to write up on the blackboard as you were going.  But moving from someone who you \nsaid that you didn’t feel was good at it, to being someone who was good at it, what did that \ninvolve in actually doing it at the front? \n \nA long struggle [laughs].  I mean, it’s not trivial, preparing a good lecture course.  It’s in a way \nharder than even writing a book, because you’ve got to make it short enough to fit into the \ntime available.  You’ve got to find useful abbreviations, economical ways to write the \nequations, judge which equations to leave out.  You can’t put every detail down.  You’ve got \nto put enough down, though, that they can reconstruct it afterwards.  So, as I say – a long \nstruggle, that ended up with the handout-note technique, in my case.  I know its... some of \nmy colleagues are brilliant at the blackboard.  They are fluent, they can write clearly and yet \nfaster than I can, and somehow seem to avoid making mistakes.  I think they’ve probably got \nclear notes that they work from, although I can tell you one exception to that. \n \nOne of my pure-maths lecturers back in Dunedin, when I was an undergraduate, gave \nperfect lectures [Dr Warren Wong].  I never caught him out in a mistake.  He wrote out... this \nwas lectures on modern algebra: abstract algebra, matrix theory, and minimal polynomials \nMichael McIntyre Page 219 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n219 \nand all of those things.  He gave lectures, on that, completely out of his head.  He must have \nhad an eidetic memory, like David Crighton or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  He just had it in \nhis head, and he wrote it neatly out on the board, and talked about it at a nice leisurely \npace.  It was quite easy to take notes.  But  [as said earlier] I don’t have that sort of memory, \nor... well organised... I don’t get anything well organised until I’ve struggled with it and \nrearranged it quite a number of times [on paper or computer, or both]. \n \n[I think Crighton and Mozart did the same sort of rearrangement, but mostly in their heads – though I \ndo have a Mozart autograph showing that, contrary to folklore, he sometimes had nontrivial second \nthoughts after writing things out.  In the second movement of the great F major piano concerto, K \n459, there are messy crossings-out where he completely changed the shape and rhythm of bars 66–\n78.] \n \n[1:11:10] \n \nYou asked me to remind you of the Adams–Airy affair, a Little... \n \nYeah, because that’s one of the stories Littlewood tells in his Miscellany, which I’ve \nmentioned before – which is wonderfully entertaining if... [for] anyone interested in... the \nadventures of the intellect, as it were... I mean... of any sort.  I mean, Littlewood was a \nmathematic[al] function theorist, but... it applies to any, you know, endeavour at getting... at \ngetting any depth of understanding.  So... \n \nAnd he has bits about what I call ‘lucidity principles’.  He’s got a little bit about the \ninexperienced research student writing something that’s almost unintelligible, because he \n[the student] thinks he’s just got to put down all the gory details, and hasn’t thought of a way \nof, you know, saying what the main point is.  He’s [Littlewood has] got a little passage where \nhe says the... a well written... and I can’t remember the exact words, but something that’s \nwell written... is organised in such a way that you can take in the essential idea at a glance.  \nMichael McIntyre Page 220 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n220 \nIf you want to check a detail, you’re given a little problem to solve, which you can, if you \nwant to be sure.  Or you can skip it without losing the thread.  The inexperienced writer \ngives the reader “no such chance,” says Littlewood.  And then he gives an example, this \nabsolutely gory [mass of equations and symbols], proving a certain theorem of Weierstrass \n[laughs].  And it’s a complete haystack in which there are all sorts of needles – including \nmisprints – so you have to... you can’t  get the essential point without teasing your way \nthrough every tiny detail.  And then he contrasts it with a ‘civilised proof’. \n \nHe says, “A civilised proof is as follows.”  And he starts with a picture, of course, because \nLittlewood... I mean, he always said, he always thought in pictures whenever possible, but of \ncourse you have to use symbols as well; so his stance on that is rather like [Lighthill’s and] \nmine.  So he presents a little picture.  You’ve got to consider this part of the plane [he says] \nand, you know, you have a certain function in this rectangle, and you have to match it to \nsomething else.  So the idea is perfectly clear.  And then you relegate the technical details to, \nyou know, a few little well-defined statements that can be checked if you so wish.  So that’s \nhis take on ‘lucidity principles’. \n \nBut the other thing is... this other story, the Adams–Airy Affair [as recounted by Littlewood, and \nimperfectly remembered by me:] – this is John Couch Adams, the... who was a brilliant... like my \nRupert Ford, a brilliant theoretician, who had all the mathematical details clear in his head, \nand he did all these complicated celestial-mechanics calculations.  And he did a calculation \nabout why the planet Uranus was going slightly differently from what it would if it were the \noutermost planet.   You know, it would slow down here and speed up there.  And this was, \ny’know, known because of very accurate observations that were by then available.  And \nAdams looked at this, and worked out that there has to be another planet, there has to be a \nplanet outside the orbit of Uranus.  And that’s... is the planet that we now call Neptune. \n \nSo this was about the discovery of Neptune.  And famously, not only Adams but a \nFrenchman called Le Verrier did this calculation, and what actually happened was that Le \nVerrier asked the French Astronomical... you know, the observatory [in fact the German \nastronomer Johann Galle in Berlin] to point the telescope to find this planet, and they did [in \nMichael McIntyre Page 221 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n221 \n1846].  So he... they had the glory of the first discovery of Neptune.  Adams was trying to get \nour Astronomer Royal, who was Sir George Biddell Airy, he of Airy functions – trying to get \nhim to point the telescope.  And Airy was sympathetic and, you know, he could see that, you \nknow, perhaps they ought to consider interrupting their important routine programmes of \nobservations to accommodate this young man’s bright idea.  But first of all he had better be \nconvinced that the young man knew what he was talking about.  So [in a letter from Airy to \nAdams]: Mr Adams, could you possibly tell me this, that and the other about the \ntechnicalities of the calculation? [laughs]. \n \nAnd Adams made his fatal error because Adams – being afraid to insult the great man’s \nintelligence – wrote back to say, oh, that’s just a trivial matter, you don’t have to worry, or \nsomething like that [actually worse: according to Littlewood, Adams sent no reply at all – saying \nlater, in private, that he’d considered Airy’s question trivial], whereas what Adams should have \ndone was to try to answer the question seriously in full detail.  But the twist in the tale is \nthat, if Adams had done that, he would have discovered that what he’d said in the first place \n[or, rather, what he’d thought at the time – about Airy’s question – and said during the Royal \nAstronomical Society’s post-mortem a year later] was wrong [laughs].  He’d actually made a slip.  \nAnd that’s the other point I always make to my students.   Just by trying to write something \n– to get a fully lucid description of something you’ve done – is valuable to you because you \nwill pick up your own mistakes that way [laughs]. \n \n[Another interesting point about Adams’ slip is that he seems to have been too sophisticated – failing \nto look at the problem from more than one viewpoint, such as “noticing very simple things” as I put it \nearlier.] \n \n[1:16:16] \n \nYou said that when you were younger you dreamt of... you had flight dreams, and a great \ninterest in flight, and that you’d been able to realise that later, but I wonder whether you \nMichael McIntyre Page 222 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n222 \ncould tell the story of that.  I gather that you might have learnt to fly; perhaps I \nmisunderstood? \n \nYeah, yeah.  [Answer is yes!]  I think I’ve said enough about childhood flying dreams.  I mean, \nyou know, silly in a way, just trying to get airborne by some amazing physical effort, and in \nthe dream succeeding of course, and staying up and loving the feeling of it, although it was \nalways hard work, you know [laughs].  But that was all there was to it really.  I didn’t have \nany great adventures.  I didn’t go to fairyland or, you know, go anywhere in particular.  I \nsimply was getting airborne, that was all there was. \n \nBut what I was interested in is the story of how you... \n \nSo now... that was just part of my psychological background for ages and ages.  And of \ncourse I read books on gliding, and occasionally watched gliders in the air, and had a vague \nlonging, I’d love to try that.  I think my father... you know, it goes back... well, of course, \nwhen I was a little kid I was interested in model aeroplanes, and I think my father gave me a \nbook on gliding.  [Or maybe the book was just there, on a bookshelf  at home.]  Yes, it was called \nFlight without Power, by Philip Wills.  Philip Wills was a well known, I think British, glider \npilot...  Probably this goes back to the 1930s...  But it was a beautiful book, with photos of \nwonderful sleek gliders, and clouds of various sorts – you know, you have to get very familiar \nwith different sorts of clouds if you want to do gliding. \n \nAnd in those days there weren’t any two-seaters, if I remember, so when you were a learner \nyou had to just go by yourself, you had to go solo straight away.  But there was a sort of low-\nlevel glider that was a bit like my stick model aircraft – almost.  Didn’t have much of a proper \nfuselage, just a few girders and things, and a rather crude wing, so it was enough to get \nairborne in.  But if the pupil crashed it, it wouldn’t be too big a loss, I think the thinking was \n[laughs].  So... and you had that level, and then you had another level and, finally, you had \nthe high-performance things that you would graduate to. \nMichael McIntyre Page 223 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n223 \n \nNow... so, these were just dreams, most of my working life, because I didn’t consider I could \nafford... gliding seemed like an expensive luxury, both in time and in money.  The family \nwould come first, of course.  But when the family were grown up... I was once on a visit to \ncolleagues in America, and one of them, still a friend of mine, a man called Murry Salby – I \nhave a disagreement with him about the climate system, but that’s by the by.  Murry and I \nare good friends, and he was a glider pilot and took me up, and let me do quite a bit of the \nflying.  So I had the feel of actually flying in thermals and things, from that.  And that sort of \nheightened my desire to learn to fly.  And I was freer to do it by then, and decided to have a \nshot at gliding at the Cambridge Gliding Club. \n \nAnd what really got me hooked... oh, I missed out something.  I did have an Acorn \nmicrocomputer.  Do you remember those... the BBC Microcomputer made by Acorn?  This \nkind of takes us back to, I suppose, the ‘80s, doesn’t it?  When did they... it was sometime \naround then.  It was a great success in the schools and everything.  Anyway, I happened to \nhave one of these things, and a piece of software called Aviator that actually simulated flight \ndynamics moderately well...  Must have been some very clever programming to get it into \nthat tiny computer.  So there was a crude graphical display of the view from the flight deck, \nand you had a little joystick.  So you could fly on the joystick.  And I never got around to \nbuilding a rudder... some rudder pedals [were allowed for], but it flew all right just on the \njoystick.  Some planes do this better than others, by the way.  With a real glider you must \nhave rudder pedals, otherwise you skew all over the sky.  You’ve got to use the pedals and \nthe stick together.  That’s because the aileron drag on the long wings is so enormous  [or \nrather, its moment arm, hence torque]. \n \nBut anyway, I learnt to land this thing [the flight simulator].  It was actually much more difficult \nto land the computer plane than a real plane, because you have much less visual input – \nmuch less accurate sense of your distance from the ground, which is a bit critical [laughs].  \nAnyway, I did a lot of practice on this thing, rather obsessively, for a few years, and finally \nwent to the Cambridge Gliding Club and got myself a trial flight.  And the weather was \nbeautiful.  The view was enchanting.   You know, it was one of those showery light... well, \nMichael McIntyre Page 224 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n224 \nfair-weather cumulus rather, not showery.  But, you know, the dappled sunshine on the \ngreen fields was a beautiful sight.  So it was just magical. \n \nAnd so I... once we’d got off the ground, I was allowed to take the controls and stooge \naround, and try a turn and so on.  And by the time we had to come in to land, he actually let \nme land the glider myself!  This was a huge surprise.   I thought you’d have to have many \nsessions before you’d be allowed to do that.  But actually it was amazing how well instinct \nserves you...  You know, in... you know how gliding works.  There’s a standard routine for \nlanding.  You first fly downwind to just beyond the end of the airfield, then you make two \nturns to come back the other way, into the wind, and land safely.  And on the final turn, \nthat’s a little tricky: you’ve got to get that right.  You might stall or something nasty, and \nyou’re quite near the ground by then [laughs].  So I... that was a bit wobbly when I did that, \nso the instructor sort of said, “Oh, I’ll straighten her out” and he seized the controls for a \nmoment, and got her heading nicely in the right direction, and then he let me do the rest of \nthe landing!  He just said, “Okay, now you can land her.”  And the sheer confidence[-building \nvalue]... I thought... and I sort of managed to land without too much of a mishap.  And that \nwas such a thrill – complete, wonderful surprise. \n \nAnd that got me hooked, you see.  I joined the club.  And I first went solo in 1990, same year \nas I got into the Royal Society.  1990 was a red-letter year for me in two ways [laughs].  So I \nwent gliding quite often for, I don’t know, ten years or so, I think, before I finally felt I didn’t \nreally have time for it any more.  I had one or two negative experiences.  There was one \ninstructor who... you know, the trouble with it is that you’ve got to spend a lot of time \nstanding around and pushing gliders, and helping other people get launched.   And that’s fun \nfor a while, but after a while you begin to be conscious that the time you spend flying is a \nrather small fraction of the time you devote to the sport. \n \nAnd there was one occasion when I was, you know, doing a flight with an instructor, I don’t \neven remember whether... it must have been after going solo.  They must have been doing \nsome sort of check [which they do routinely, of course].  I really don’t remember.  But for one \nreason or another this instructor grabbed the controls; he said, “You’re at the wrong angle,” \nMichael McIntyre Page 225 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n225 \nhe said, “Do it like this.”  And he grabbed the controls.  And that I really resented, because it \nwas depriving me of those precious few minutes of practice when I could have, with my \nhands on, corrected the fault [and of course learned about it much better].  I could have gone \nsteeper if he’d just given me another second or two, or shallower, or whatever it had to be.  \n(This is a winch launch.  You go up very steeply – it’s rather thrilling [laughs] – and it all \nhappens very quickly, of course.)  So this guy... I really resented that.  Here, I’d been hanging \naround for an hour and a half or so, and got my first flight, and all of a sudden I wasn’t \ngetting the practice from those precious few minutes.  And so I sort of got turned off it a bit \nmore.  I kept thinking, well, if I can find another club, or perhaps just do it in summer camps \nor whatever – but that was just one little incident, I suppose.  I mean, the rest of the time my \nexperience was pretty positive.  But I suppose what really happens is, you have enough of it \nto satisfy the original longing and urge and so you... your attention turns to other things.  I \nthink it happens to all of us.   \n \nAnd how did you find the experience of flight itself? \n \nOh, thrilling – especially the first time I went solo.  I mean, that was another huge thrill – that \nthey would trust me to take a little glider up all by myself – of course, you know, trying to be \ncareful to get things right and so on.  They don’t let you go solo till you’ve gone through \nquite a lot of routine... including getting out of spins, very importantly.   \n \nDid it key in in any way to... I know you worked on the stratosphere, and you weren’t gliding \nin the stratosphere, but did it key in in any way to your scientific knowledge of dynamics?   \n \nWell, generally it was a thrill to be actually feeling the motion of the atmosphere that I’d \nthought about for so long, even though the things you feel are much smaller-scale motions \nthan the ones my professional work has been about.  But it’s part of the background to know \nabout those smaller-scale motions.  I mean, when you’re gliding you’re in the convection \ncurrents.  In this part of the world [near Cambridge] that’s about the only way you can stay up, \nMichael McIntyre Page 226 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n226 \nthermal convection.  There aren’t enough hills for any significant hill, you know, lee-wave or \n[gravity-wave] lift or anything like that. \n \nAnd can you just say a little bit more about... I think you said that you obsessively played the \nAviator or ran the Aviator?   \n \nAviator was this program – this flight-simulator program...  But... by today’s standards rather \na crude thing, but it did simulate the dynamics of an aeroplane in quite a reasonable way.  I \nthink it was solving the equations of motion. \n \nAnd why did you say that you practised that obsessively? \n \nBecause I was... that was before I had done much [real] flying.  I think I’d gone flying with \nMurry in America.  Or it might have even been before that.  I was still subject to this longing \nto fly – for one reason or another – and doing it on the computer was the only available way \nat the time. \n \nSo how often would you go on the computer?   \n \nWell, because the computer was sitting there at home, I could easily spend half an hour on it \nevery evening, without losing too much momentum in other directions.  You know, if I had \nlecture-preparation pressures I probably wouldn’t fire up the computer, but, you know, \nthere are plenty of odd moments when you can.  We weren’t playing musical concerts by \nthen, so I didn’t have the need to practise in the evenings. \n \n[1:27:13] \nMichael McIntyre Page 227 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n227 \n \nAnd when you did stop gliding, I think you said around 2000, did anything take over as the \nsort of next hobby or next interest? \n \nHmm, it’s a... I’m trying to think about the history.  Gliding sort of gradually faded out.  I \nactually kept paying my membership, but I discovered I wasn’t bothering to go out there any \nmore for, you know, two or three years, and then finally I resigned my membership.  I still \nhad an idea I might go on a summer camp and finish my Silver C.  You know, the Silver C is \nthe first big qualification.  I got the Bronze C, that’s the level you’ve got to reach in order to \nbe allowed to fly cross-country. \n \nBut then I was stuck, because our car didn’t have a proper tow bar on it.  So I couldn’t offer \nto retrieve other people’s gliders.  When you go cross-country, you’ve got to make a deal \nwith a fellow glider pilot and say – okay – if you pick me up if I’ve got to land out – you know, \npart of the training is how to land in any field – then I’d do the same for him or her.  And I \ncouldn’t offer that, ’cause our car didn’t have the right bit on the back [laughs].  So I was a \nlittle stuck.  I wasn’t sure how to do that. \n \nI had this dream of perhaps going on a summer course where that part of it would be \norganised for us.  But I never got around to doing it, because it was quite hard to find a club \nwhere you’d get enough flying.  You know, you expect to pay more, obviously; but they have \nto be very well organised for you to get enough hours in the air.  And, you know, you might \ngo on the camp for a week, but would you get suitable cross-country weather or not?  It’s a \nbit of a gamble.  I ended up not getting around to it [laughs]. \n \nI’ve got all my Silver C apart from the [cross-]country distance.  You’ve got to do a height \ngain.  I got that locally, ’cause the cloud base was high enough one day and one of the \ninstructors said, “Hey, why don’t you go for the height today?  Look how high the clouds \nMichael McIntyre Page 228 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n228 \nare.”  And I did.  And those... this was quite a while ago... you had to smoke this piece of \npaper, and wind it up on a mechanical barograph [drum] to prove you’d been so high. \n \nYou don’t do that now; it’s all done on GPS, of course [laughs].  That makes cross-country \nflying a lot easier too.  In the old days you had to be sure you could recognise particular \nlandmarks; they’re called turning points.  You had to fly to a known landmark, go around it, \nand photograph the landmark during the turn, so it was plain that you’d got past that point.  \nBut again GPS, I think, takes care of that sort of thing now. \n \nAnd so did another enthusiasm replace gliding once you’d... ? \n \nWell, it’s a good question.  I’m not aware of any... gosh, what happened?  Because the \ngliding... interest in the gliding sort of faded gradually.  I think part of old age is that your \ndesire to do these things gets less intense.  Alright, at some point... well okay, we did have \nthis burst of musical activity.  I told you, didn’t I?  When David Crighton died, our visionary \nHead of Department – have I spoken of that before?   \n \nYou’ve said a little, not of the music that happened. \n \nYeah.  I think I mentioned that David was a visionary Department leader, and an inspiring \nleader – one of these people who believe in life-enhancing things, including encouraging \neveryone to give their best professionally.  And including a love of music, ’cause music was \nvery important [to him].  He always used to say, he really wanted to be a musician.  And \nbeing an applied mathematician was the second-best thing.  But he was an absolutely \nbrilliant applied mathematician, I have to say, as well as Department leader – the sort of \nperson who could cope with the bureaucracy in the way I can’t possibly. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 229 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n229 \nYou know, he actually enjoyed playing their silly games, and being a few steps ahead of them \non a committee.  You know, David was very skilful...  A piece of nonsense starting to rear its \nhead... he’d put it down with a few beautifully chosen words.  He would keep us on target \nabout the things that matter. \n \nSo that was David.  He got cancer and died in, I think, 2000, and his widow asked us to play a \nmemorial concert, ’cause she knew we’d played professionally in the past.  And we wanted \nto give David the best concert we could, so we worked very hard at that, and we gave the \nconcert in May of 2001 if I remember correctly.  Well, it’s on my webpage, if you’re \ninterested.  There’s still a few CDs of it left! \n \nBut anyway... he... you know... that would have been fully eating up my spare time around \nthen, and I think that might be the answer to your question.  [Or part of the answer.  I now also \nremember that part of the buildup to the Crighton concert, over several years, was a big effort to \ndeepen my knowledge of musical composition.  I think it was bound up with the struggle to write the \nLucidity papers.]  That would have completely killed off any remaining interest in gliding, \ndoing that concert.  ’Cause you see, we... it wasn’t just workin’m up.  We thought we must \ndo our best.  It’s a long time since we’d played to a high standard; we’d better go and, you \nknow, try it out in front of, you know, people who know what they’re doing.  And in fact, we \nwent to... Two summers in succession, we went to a sort of summer school in the north of \nFrance, where members of the Lindsay Quartet were the coaches, and we got some lovely \ncoaching from them.  Bernard Gregor-Smith, the ’cellist, and Ronnie what’s-his-name [Birks] \nwho played second violin, especially, very good and encouraging.   [On checking my records, I \nfind that only the first of those occasions was before the Crighton concert .  Evidently we were still \nswitched-on enough to go for the following summer as well – working on an amazing piece, Villa-\nLobos’ Piano Trio no. 3.] \n \nAnd then we did another session of being coached by Andrew Watkinson, the leader of the \nEndellion Quartet.  Andrew’s an artistic genius.  He has a wonderful way with the violin, of \nwidening the range of voices it can speak in, and so I’ve always... we’ve always admired him \nvery much.  And so we got him to listen through the things for this [Crighton] concert, when \nMichael McIntyre Page 230 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n230 \nwe’d got them to an advanced stage of preparation.  And he was very good, of course, in \nhoning up some parts of the performance.  And then we finally gave the performance, and it \nwas a great success and it was even good enough to have a recording issued afterwards.  It’d \nhelp with the fundraising.  Because Mrs Crighton’s idea was to raise some funds in David’s \nmemory.  You know, there was a mathematics fund, and a music fund, and there was... well, \nsome of the time we were raising money for both, and some of the time we were raising \nmoney just for the music – that’s a detail.  And that was a wonderful occasion.  It was very \nwell attended because David, of course, was very well loved and admired by very many of \nour colleagues, so we had a full concert hall in the West Road Concert Hall over there.  It’s a \nbeautiful acoustic.  And that was a great occasion.   \n \n[1:34:10] \n \nSo that... now, you might ask what I was doing after that.  We did have... having worked \nourselves up to a professional standard of performance again, we did play in one or two \nother things.  Well, a friend of ours... they had a wedding anniversary, a fortieth wedding \nanniversary, I think, and they invited us to play a little concert for them, which was a lot of \nfun.  They’re very special friends.  There was at least one other such occasion, I’ve forgotten.  \n[And we did make quite a decent recording of the Villa-Lobos trio, around then.] \n \nSo for a while we were all playing music together as in the old days; but finally that died off.  \nI think we realised we weren’t going to be able to keep up the intensity of that.  You know, \nwe’d been there, we’d done that, we wouldn’t have missed it for worlds – but then it was \ntime to move on to, you know, facing old age, and perhaps seeing that the kids were okay, \nand seeing that the house was okay. \n \nIn recent years I’ve spent quite a lot of time on, you know, just things around the house.  I \nlove using my hands.  I was very keen to get, you know, a bit of renewable energy into the \nhouse.  It’s an old house.  [Fairly old – 1938.]  The insulation standards will never be properly \npassive or anything.   Y’know, it does have a cavity wall that’s been pumped with foam, but \nMichael McIntyre Page 231 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n231 \nthat’s not really [indeed, not nearly] good enough by what’s... we need to do.  But, you know, \nwe did all the standard things, like huge loft insulation.  And we’ve got solar photovoltaic \npanels .  We managed to get in while the government was giving a generous so called ‘feed-\nin tariff’.   So – actually that was like using... putting some of our savings into an ISA that’s \nabout double the usual interest rate [quadruple now, as the bankers continue their power games], \nso that was a good deal, financially, as well as being... helping a little bit with the cultural \nsea-change that we need for renewable energy – a tiny, tiny drop in that ocean. \n \nWe’ve got a beautiful solar-thermal system as well, developed in Germany.  It uses the \navailable solar power very cleverly, mostly for hot water of course, but a bit for central \nheating as well – and a beautiful piece of engineering.  [Including the way it manages the fluid \ndynamics!]  So that’s been fun, getting to know that, in a slightly perverse way because the... \nit’s funny, it’s a beautiful system, but the manuals are written in Martian – like the average \ncomputer manual – and I had to spend a lot of time discovering how the system works, by \nexperimentation [laughs]. \n \nGo on, say how you did that. \n \nOh, it’s boring really.  I mean, you know, you’d read these manuals, you’d manage to \ndecipher some of it.  They... Perfect example of anti-lucidity, you know – highly technical \nstuff, but always using different names for the same thing, and the same name for different \nthings, all over the place.  [And there’s a huge number of technical things!]  So you had... it was \nlike decoding the Rosetta stone.  So I... my copies have huge handwritten notes, written \neverywhere.  So I did that as much [as I could]... and then, of course, they don’t... there were \nsome things they just don’t tell you; it was not complete either.  So there are some things... \nthe only way to find out is to try it, you know, try different settings and see what happens.  \nBoring though, you know, you’ve just got to try and stick at it. \n \nBut I’ve reached the point where I pretty much know how to work it.  I like to play games \nwith the outside [temperature] sensor.  The idea of how it controls the house temperature is \nMichael McIntyre Page 232 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n232 \nbeautiful.  It’s a very smooth control – a closely accurate control that’s based on sensing the \noutside temperature, with a little bit of input from room temperature in the main area.  And \nit’s got a lot of artificial intelligence that translates that into the amount of heat output, \nagain, in ways that I had to discover by experimentation.  But I’ve got it working, nicely \ntuned up.  [The outside sensor has to be positioned, and radiation-shielded, entirely differently from \nwhat the manual says!]  It keeps the temperature nice and even, and... copes with the frost. \n \nThat was another problem: the installers mis-installed the pipes to the solar panels.  This \nsystem works by draining.  When solar power isn’t available, it just drains all the water out, \nso you don’t need any nasty anti-freeze chemicals.  You just store the heat in a huge tank, \nwhich is quite well insulated.  But the installers didn’t realise that the pipes from... between \nthe panels and the tank had to be downhill all the way, otherwise water would accumulate \nand freeze in the frosty conditions – and not just stop it working, but possibly damage the \npipes as well.  But luckily we got away with that.  I managed to get the pipes re-sloped \nmyself.  I would get a... got a ladder and got up on the roof, and fiddled around with \naluminium angle, and struts, and this and that, until I had the pipes properly sloping.  So it \nworks fine now [laughs]. \n \nI like doing that sort of thing.  It’s... you know, it’s a low level of experimentation, if you like; \nbut it’s satisfying to see something working properly. \n \nAnd have you used personal computers – other than for making music and briefly for flight \nsimulation?   Are there other sort of leisure uses of personal computers? \n \nHmm, well, we all use computers for practically everything these days.  The answer is \nessentially, yes, I’ve always had to use them for professional work.  I mean, you can’t go to a \nconference without a computerised talk these days.  I was one of the last to go over from \nthe old overhead transparencies to computerised stuff.  But, well, I mean, I’ve done that for \nten years, I suppose, by now.  So I’ve always had some sort of laptop or other to do that, and \nMichael McIntyre Page 233 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n233 \nnaturally you... you know, when your kids say there’s this or that on YouTube, you can’t... \nmustn’t miss it, I’ll use it to see that.  So you just use it for whatever comes up. \n \nI don’t do twittering, tweeting and facebooking.  I was on Facebook for a little while, but I \ndiscovered it wasn’t helping me, because the people who wanted to know me were the \npeople I knew already, so I’d have their emails anyway, so there’s not much point.  I think if \nyou’re very young you have to, ’cause that’s what all your friends do.  They don’t have email, \nthey have Facebook instead, don’t they, so that’s a different world.  It’s terrifying, though, \nbecause the owners of Facebook owns your information.  They have copyright in everything \nyou do.  I don’t like that.  They’ve got much too much power over people’s personal lives, \npotentially. \n \n[1:40:24] \n \nAnd what was the effect on your career of becoming an FRS? \n \nOh, well, not huge.  Of course it’s awfully pleasing to be elected to the Royal Society.  It’s a \nbig honour.  It’s a mark that things you’ve... some of what you’ve done is regarded as having \nbeen important and influential.  But...  And of course it brings some responsibilities.  You \nthen have to be prepared to, you know, act as a referee in ways that you wouldn’t have \nbefore.  But a lot of that’s very positive.  I mean, I’ve helped to get other people in who, I’ve \nstrongly felt, deserved to be FRSs.  One of them was David Crighton actually.  It’s amazing \nthat he didn’t get in before me, because he was an absolutely brilliant... but, you know, it’s \nrough justice [at best].  There’s a certain chanciness about these things, and it just happened \nthat I got in first.  So I had the pleasure of helping to get him in [laughs].  [And anyone who \nsuspects mere cronyism need only read David’s papers – it was very easy for me to make the \ncase.  And by the way, no-one gets in unless several international referees are strongly \npositive.] \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 234 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 7 \n \n234 \nWhat is involved in helping to get someone in?  What’s the sort of criteria?   \n \nWell, you see, I’ll tell you why it was a pleasure.  It’s because what you have to do... you \nhave... well, you might or might not get asked, but I was asked to be one of the referees for \nhis election.  And, well, it’s like being referee for anything else, but you’ve got to argue that \nthe guy [or gal]’s done something to a very high standard of originality, as well as technical \nprowess and creativity.  [And honesty and integrity counts heavily too.]  With David, that \nwas not difficult.  So I mean, most of his work was a bit... you know, it wasn’t quite in my \narea, so I had to work quite hard, reading quite a few of his papers.  But that was a great \npleasure, because he was a lucid thinker and writer, and what I read – a lot of it – had all \nsorts of exquisite surprises and wonderful things, little twists of, you know, understanding \nsomething.  That sort of thing gives me great pleasure.  And so I was able to say, look, this \nguy does this kind of thing, so he certainly deserves to be elected.  That’s the way it usually \nworks. \n \nYou know, if you’re electing an experimenter you’d say... talk about the clever experimental \ntechnique, or how he developed this way of observing something that had never been \nobserved before, or whatever.  You know... it’s always an argument about something new – \nsomething that’s not just clever, but actually has some importance – [something that] makes a \ndifference to scientific progress. \n \n[Susan Solomon, an American atmospheric chemist, was another outstanding case among several I \ncan think of.  It was not only for key contributions to understanding many of the complexities of \natmospheric chemistry, including ozone-hole chemistry, but also for chairing a recent IPCC report with \nfierce integrity and great tenacity and courage, always up against the power of the professional \ndisinformers – clearly and soberly speaking truth to power.  And, to my great delight, as a result of all \nthis she was recently elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society, a very high honour indeed.] \n \n[End of Track 7] \nMichael McIntyre Page 235 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n235 \nTrack 8 \n \nCould you say something about the use of potential vorticity in numerical weather forecasting?   \n \nYes.  Well, I’ve always had this... dream... er, a pipe-dream... a sort of wish list – because in my work \nit’s been conspicuous for ages that you get a lot of insight by just looking at potential-vorticity \ndistributions.  And the sort of dynamics that that informs you about is exactly the sort of dynamics \nthat applies to the development of weather systems.  And so you’d think that it would help a \nweather forecaster to be able to see the PV distributions, and... Of course there’s a little technical \nproviso: you’ve got to include surface temperature as well.  (For systems like... weather cyclones, \nfronts, and anticyclones the temperature near the ground is actually of comparable importance to \nthe PV.  In fact, we think of it as part of the PV field.) \n \nBut anyway, you’ve got... visualising those things is insightful about the dynamics, at least \nqualitatively.  Now... so this made me think... and I actually wrote an essay on this called A Dream \n[actually Vision] of the Future [in fact three versions were published, of which the last was called Numerical \nweather prediction: a vision of the future, updated still further], in which I imagined that the full potential \nof this idea was realised with, as it were, ace forecasters, who become real experts at seeing the \ncomplicated three-dimensional features of the potential-vorticity and surface-temperature fields – \nand aided by modern computerised visualisation.  Perhaps some day in the future it could all be \ndone holographically, or something.  Somehow you could get the three-dimensional picture in a very \nquick and intuitive way.  And that perhaps there will be ace forecasters part of whose work would be \nto – almost – fly among these features and grasp their three-dimensional nature and, through their \nlong experience and intuition, see... spot the cases where the forecasts needed correcting  [and how \nto correct them]. \n \nAnd this is rather against the usual culture in the weather-forecasting world, which quite reasonably \nsays that... well no, these things are too complicated for human perception to have any role at all; \nand the whole thing has to be automated and computerised.  And to some extent they’re right.  It is \nMichael McIntyre Page 236 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n236 \ncomplicated, and indeed the progress that’s been made with computerised systems and, as I said \nbefore, four-dimensional data assimilation... a lot of that really has to be automated. \n \nHowever, of course if you go into it a bit more deeply and, you know, if you talk to people like Adrian \nSimmons, who’s in that business – my first student long ago – and... he’ll... you learn that actually \nhuman intervention still goes on, because... of course [for one thing] the data that comes in isn’t all \ncorrect.  You’ve got to be able to detect when people report a radiosonde balloon sounding that \nthey didn’t really do, you know, because some bureaucrat paid them to put in a report, but they \ndidn’t happen to have the balloon to do it, or whatever the reason.  And so the people in the \nbusiness actually know that some stations are suspect, and they have sort of a balance of \nprobabilities on how much – which data you believe more – and that tends to get built into the \nsystem.  [But kept under review, i.e., subject to human judgement and intervention.]  And, you know, \nlooking at potential-vorticity fields at least has a potential for detecting that sort of thing as well, \nthough I don’t really know how useful it would be. \n \nHowever, that was my dream of the future.  I don’t think very much has come of it as yet, but there \nare sort of signs – slight signs – here and there.  There’s a chap in the French Meteorological Service \ncalled Philippe Arbogast, who has constructed a PV inverter.  Of course you’d need a PV inverter [an \naccurate one] if you were to use this operationally, because you’d need to do things like... hey, my \nexperience tells me this feature should have a different shape: I’m going to redraw it and I’m going \nto invert.  Now I’m going to have a different set of wind fields.  I’m going to re-run the forecast with \na slightly different wind field, and see if it looks better.  This is all assuming that great human \nexperience, and high human skills, can make a contribution, doing that sort of thing.  Well, he \n[Arbogast] and one or two others, I think, are sort of working at it and hoping for some \ndevelopments.  That’s all I know.  I haven’t been close to that business in recent years. \n \n[0:04:48] \n \nWhat makes you think that it is a combination of the human and the computer that is needed, rather \nthan the computer? \nMichael McIntyre Page 237 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n237 \n \nOkay.  That’s a very good question; and I think it comes from recognising that human perception and \nintelligence is still much more powerful than our electronic computers in some ways.  And a good \nway to make that point is to point out that computers don’t yet drive taxis, do they?  Artificial-\nintelligence people have been hoping for machine vision to reach that point, but it’s been very, very \nhard to get it there.  And you can... you know, if you think about how perception works you can, I \nthink, have some insight into why.  It’s because it requires massively parallel computing.  You have to \ndeal with a combinatorially large number of possibilities at once.  That’s all related to this \nunconscious power of abstraction that we have.  And electronic computers aren’t yet as good as we \nare, at some of those things.  So one day perhaps computers will be built with the sort of massive \nparallelism that our brains have.  But it’s a tall order because, you know... well, if you read Kevin \nWarwick’s book, which uses the old naïve view of the nervous system as nothing but neurons and \nsynapses and nerve fibres, [with the neurons as] simple switches – that’s only the tip of the \ncomputational iceberg.  The real nervous system is much, much more sophisticated [and its massively-\nparallel power much, much harder to match than the book suggests]. \n \nIt has many levels of computation, all the way down to the molecular level, in which computation is \ndone by molecules called allosteric enzymes, which are protein molecules that can go into different \nstates depending on what’s attached to them, and then in turn catalyse different chemical reactions.  \nSo they’re like transistors, you see.  [Or ‘logic element’ might be a better term.]  And these days people \nwho work on these problems talk about protein ‘circuits’, meaning... using this sort of logic element.  \nSo that... of course you’ve got lots of levels of that going on within a single synapse.  So our \nmassively parallel computing – we’ve barely scratched the surface of understanding how it works.  I \nthink it’s an interesting open question as to what combination of human and machine intelligence is \nmost powerful. \n \nI would argue that some combination is [sure to be] powerful.  And if we do things that use our \npowers of visual perception – which is a very sophisticated part of our perceptual apparatus – then \nthere’s scope for doing better than we could do either by ourselves, or the machines by themselves.  \nSo I still have that dream, although it’s, you know, hardly got going as yet. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 238 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n238 \n[0:07:42] \n \nCould you now tell the story of your... the development of your interest in the Sun and... \n \nYes, okay.  Well, that’s another thing that had gradual beginnings, purely by chance, I suppose.  I’ve \nalways been personal friends with one or two of, you know, the great thinkers in solar physics and \nastrophysics.  One of them is a man called Edward Spiegel, who ages ago taught me... began to teach \nme what I know about solar physics.  And the other is Douglas Gough, who is now known as one of \nthe great gurus of what’s called helioseismology, and that is the ability to sense the structure of the \nSun using the sound waves that bounce around inside it. \n \nNow it’s a piece of scientific good luck that the Sun is a very... what we call a high-Q acoustic \noscillator.  It means that the surface – it’s somewhere near the visible surface of the Sun – is an \nexcellent reflector of sound waves.  That’s just an accident really of how the, you know, profiles of \ntemperature and pressure work out.  So if you start a sound wave inside the Sun, it tends to bounce \naround a lot.  And it’s like... to excite the Sun is like hitting a gong, you know, it rings for a long time.  \nAnd if you observe accurately these oscillations – and there are very sophisticated instruments that \nhave been doing this for many decades now – you can analyse their frequencies, and sort out which \nmodes of vibration the Sun is oscillating in.  It’s a bit like a violin string, which has many modes of \noscillation.  But the Sun has even more.  So you’ve got an awful lot of information about those \nfrequencies of acoustic oscillations, and what you can do, from that, is to back out the internal \nstructure of the Sun in an amazing amount of detail.  And that’s one of the most powerful \nconstraints on our theories of the Sun’s structure, and... on what we base things like how much \nlonger is it going to last, which is a few thousand million years.   All of that – things we believe we \nknow about the Sun – we know with very high confidence because the models of the Sun, the \ncomputer models, are all checked [very accurately] against these helioseismic observations. \n \nSo that’s a great scientific story that my friend Douglas was... has made a large part of his career.  \n(And he’s another lovely scientist.  You can talk about anything with Douglas and, you know [as with \nMichael McIntyre Page 239 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n239 \nNick Shackleton and others I could name], have an argument – “oh, that’s rubbish,” you know, and sort \nof get to the truth of the matter – without any [fear of] personal resentment.) \n \nSo, now, one of the things you can get about the Sun is its differential rotation.  Now that leads us to \na fluid-dynamical problem in which I got involved... you know, many years after first learning about \nthe Sun.  And... if you picture the Sun as a sort of orange with an extremely thick rind – and the rind \nis meant to be the convection zone, and the core is the interior, and... what you have is...  [trying first \nto clarify the significance of the rind-versus-interior distinction:]  There are two different ways the heat \ngets out of the Sun.  Okay, where’s the heat coming from?  It’s nuclear reactions near the centre.  \nAnd in most of the... in the interior, the heat comes out purely by radiation.  That’s to say, photons \nsort of push and jiggle their way outward.  And the flow of heat isn’t helped by any fluid motion at \nall.  However, as you get nearer the surface, conditions change in such a way that the most efficient \nway to get the heat out is by convection.  And that means great gobs of fluid are... it starts boiling.  \nThere’s a layer – this we call the convection zone; that’s the very thick rind of my notional orange – \nin which you have great gobs of gas sort of boiling upwards and downwards.  And that’s the main \nway the heat is carried in that part of the Sun. \n \n[0:12:13] \n \nAnd what you observe... and now, helioseismology has shown us something very interesting.  You \ncan tell the rotation rates of these different parts, because they refract the sound waves – y’know, \nlike ordinary [surface] waves being refracted by a bathtub vortex, if you will.   So it changes the \nfrequencies of the observed modes.  And from that information they can tell how fast the different \nparts are rotating.  And the... a result that surprised everyone – and this first became known, I think, \nabout twenty years ago and it’s been well verified ever since – the result was that the interior where \nthe heat gets out by radiation – let’s call it the radiative interior – that is almost exactly in solid \nrotation, to within experimental error.  We can’t see any significant departure from solid rotation.  \nIt’s as if the whole core of the Sun [the whole radiative interior] were solid, all rotating at the same \nrate, like a tennis ball.  Cricket ball would be a better analogy [not being hollow]. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 240 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n240 \nBut the convection zone is differentially rotating, some parts faster than others.  In fact, the polar \nparts are rotating more slowly than the equatorial parts, which is what you’ve... which you observe \nat the surface.  It’s been known for a long time that the surface – where the motion is marked by, \nyou know, features being carried along, including sunspots – it’s been long known that the surface \nrotates faster at the equator.  But what helioseismology shows is that that differential rotation \ncarries through all the way to the bottom of the convection zone.  And then suddenly, at the bottom \nof the convection zone, where it goes over into the calm radiative interior, you’ve got a huge \namount of vertical shear, because the different rotation rates of the convection zone can’t agree \nwith the interior everywhere.  So in the polar regions, for instance, the interior is going faster, and \nthe convection zone slower.  So there’s a lot of shear.  Shear, remember, means the change in \nvelocity.  The horizontal velocity changes a lot as you move position, in this case as you go up or \ndown.  And this shear layer is called the tachocline, which means gradient of speed.  (‘Tacho’ is \nspeed and ‘cline’ is gradient.)   Which is a reasonably good thing to call it, and... [laughs] \n \nAnd this was a great surprise because none of the fluid-dynamical ideas that people had [had \npreviously] predicted this.  There’d been all sorts of papers on the... you know, the way the Sun spun \ndown over its lifetime.  We know the Sun used to rotate a lot faster than it does now, and it spins \ndown by throwing particles out.  These are these same solar storms that might disrupt our electric \npower networks [if unusually large numbers of particles come our way] – I heard a bit about that on the \nnews recently.  So it’s always throwing these particles out; and [being charged particles, mostly \nelectrons and protons] they have to travel along magnetic field lines.  And that means it’s like a wheel \nwith rigid spokes poking out, that... with weights being beads on those wires, being thrown \noutwards.  And if you have that happening to a rotating wheel, you slow it down, because you’ve got \nan anti-ballerina effect.  And the magnitude of that is such that the Sun’s rotation has probably \ndiminished by, you know... we don’t know this very accurately, but a factor of ten or so wouldn’t be \na bad guess – since its early lifetime, a few thousand million years ago. \n \nNow... so people were interested in, how did that diminution in overall rotation rate communicate \nitself to the interior?  And there was an episode in the... I think the 1960s, if I remember, where one \nof the... a physicist called Robert Dicke suggested that the Sun’s interior was spinning much faster \nthan the outside, because then the Sun would have a slightly different shape, and then you could \nexplain the behaviour of the planet Mercury in a way that didn’t depend on Einstein’s general \nMichael McIntyre Page 241 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n241 \nrelativity, as most people believed then [to be the correct explanation] – and still believe today, I have \nto say – the precession of the perihelion of Mercury.  You could explain it by a different theory if the \nSun’s interior were rotating faster – which was of course the Brans–Dicke theory, that he wanted to \nreplace Einstein with. \n \nSo, for quite a while, there was a lot of interest in whether the spindown of the Sun could have left \nthe interior rotating much faster than the outer parts.  And all the papers on that – there was quite a \nbit of work on that, and – it all gave you the impression that the Sun’s interior was likely to have \nsome differential rotation, even if it wasn’t as much as Dicke had hoped. \n \nSo when the helioseismic observation showed the Sun’s interior actually – as far as we could see – \nwas rotating solidly, it was a great surprise.  And then my other astrophysical friend Edward Spiegel, \ntogether with a colleague called Jean-Paul Zahn, wrote a paper in 1992 in which they argued that the \ninterior is in solid rotation because it’s stably stratified.  I didn’t say this, did I, but the radiative \ninterior is stably stratified.  That’s part of why it’s very calm.  It’s like our stratosphere [fluid-\ndynamically speaking, I mean].  And if you didn’t disturb it at all, it would just sit there in its horizontal \nlayers.  But if you disturb it a bit, you might expect to get ‘horizontal turbulence’ – the sort of thing \nwe see in the stratosphere – where the motion is heavily constrained by the stratification.  It wants \nto be mostly horizontal, but can still eddy around in the sort of way that we see outside the ozone \nhole, for instance.  And Spiegel and Zahn argued that that sort of horizontal turbulent motion would \nhave a frictional effect that tended to make the interior go toward solid rotation.  And that was their \nexplanation of the tachocline: the convection zone wants to differentially rotate ’cause of its own \nconvection dynamics – and that seems to be reproduced by computer models – and so they argued, \nthe interior wants to be solid because of horizontal turbulence, and the tachocline was the shear \nlayer that has to connect the two, okay. \n \nNow, the moment I heard about that work, I knew it couldn’t be right, because I was familiar with \nwhat ‘horizontal turbulence’ really is like, in our Earth’s stratosphere.  And, as I’ve said before, the \ncharacteristic thing that happens is what you might call anti-friction.  It’s almost the opposite thing \nfrom a viscous or frictional effect.  It wants to drive the system away from solid rotation, and not \ntoward it.  So I knew that idea didn’t make sense. \nMichael McIntyre Page 242 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n242 \n \nSo I started scratching my head about what would account for the Sun’s solid interior rotation, and I \ncouldn’t think of anything – and ever since then no one else has thought of anything – that can do it, \nother than the one thing the stratosphere doesn’t have.  And that is an internal magnetic field... the \nSun’s interior is very hot, it’s an ionised plasma, and that means it’s a very good conductor of \nelectricity, and that means that any magnetic fields down there will... if they’re the right shape – and \nthat’s a not-trivial question – but certain kinds of global-scale magnetic fields in the interior can hold \nit in solid rotation  [or, to say it more carefully, can play a crucial role in so doing].  So... and I actually \ndared to pipe up and say that in a conference paper in 1994. \n \nAnd I took it further with Douglas Gough, with whom I published a paper in Nature in 1997 [oops, \n1998], in which we made a strong argument that not only could the Sun have an interior global-scale \nmagnetic field – and that was no surprise because everybody... it had been long well known that \nstars can have fields like that.  But what wasn’t known was whether they must have them, because \nthere were some theories of how such fields might get expelled when the star was forming, and \nother theories where they might get enhanced by dynamo action.  It was really completely uncertain \nwhether they had them or not. \n \nSo Douglas and I said in this paper, look, the observed solid rotation means the Sun must have an \ninterior field like this.  It’s the only way you can explain the solid rotation.  Why?  Because the only \nother available explanation, from horizontal turbulence, won’t work.  That’s not what stratified \nhorizontal turbulence is like.  And we know that very well from the Earth’s stratosphere.  So, okay, so \nfar so good.  The paper was called something like “Inevitability of an interior field in the Sun”.  \n[Actually it was called “Inevitability of a magnetic field in the Sun's radiative interior,”  Nature 394, \n755 (1998).] \n \nBut then we still had the problem of how does the Sun organise this field to be of the right shape, to \ndo this job of holding the interior in solid rotation.  And I got involved in thinking about that.  And... \npart of the reason is that... well, to cut a long story short... I wrote a number of conference papers \nand things about this, but, to cut a long story short, we ended up finally with a consistent theory of \nMichael McIntyre Page 243 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n243 \nhow this really could happen.  And the other interesting feature is, it depends on something else we \nlearnt from the stratosphere, which I’ve spoken of before, and that is, that if you exert a retrograde \nforce on a rotating fluid you get this ‘gyroscopic pumping’ effect.  And if the force is retrograde – \nthat is, against the rotation – you systematically pump stuff toward the rotation axis.  So now if you \ncan... and it doesn’t matter what causes the force.  It might be friction, as in the Einstein’s tea-leaves \nexperiment, or it might be breaking Rossby waves in the stratosphere.  In the Sun we think it’s \nactually the turbulent stresses in the convection zone [and perhaps also in some turbulent upper portion \nof the tachocline], which can exert retrograde forces. \n \nAnd our proposal for the Sun – and it isn’t fully worked out yet – but we believe we have the first \nparts of a consistent picture of how all this fits together, and part of it is that there’s a retrograde \nforce in the, y’know, high-latitude convection zone that pumps fluid polewards, which then \ndownwells on to the  [lowermost]  tachocline  \n[where it meets the much calmer interior] from the convection zone  [and/or from any other turbulent \nlayers overlying the lowermost tachocline].  So you’ve got this downwelling at both poles, which is \nactually...  Apart from the origin of the force driving it, it’s actually like the gyroscopically-pumped \npolar downwelling in the Earth’s stratosphere.  There’s an obvious point of similarity; remember, \nthat’s what carries the ozone down to the lower stratosphere.  So if you say that’s happening [the \npolar downwelling in the Sun], then immediately you’ve got the possibility of holding the interior \nmagnetic field in the required shape.  [Douglas and I had already drawn attention to this possibility; but at \nthe time we had no fully-consistent theory of the effect of the polar downwelling.] \n \nNow I should explain that, if you didn’t have this downwelling, there’s a chance that the interior field \nwould want to diffuse outwards.  It would want to poke its magnetic lines out through both poles, \nand look more like the Earth’s magnetic field.  And if it did that, it wouldn’t be able to hold all of the \ninterior in solid rotation any more.  So the name of the game is stopping that happening.  And our \nproposal is that the downwelling at the poles will confine the field because, as the field tries to \ndiffuse out, the downwelling, even though it’s extremely weak – it’s a tiny fraction of a centimetre \nper second – it’s still enough to counter that diffusion, and hold this field in the shape required to \nimpose solid rotation.  Remember, this has to be something that lasts the whole lifetime of the Sun.  \nYou’ve got to have something that holds the field in this particular shape for thousands of millions of \nMichael McIntyre Page 244 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n244 \nyears.  And that’s plenty of time for it to diffuse out, and change its shape, if it weren’t for this \ndownwelling. \n \nAnd very recently I was... lucky to have acquired a very bright research student, a young man called \nToby Wood, who’s now postdoc-ing in California [and Leeds from mid-2013]; and Toby and I together \nworked on a theory of exactly how the downwelling could hold the field in the right shape near the \npoles.  And we succeeded in finding some beautiful mathematical solutions that described how that \npart of the jigsaw fits together, which is not trivial because the... you have to take into account that \nthe Sun is rotating.  There are, for this purpose, extremely strong Coriolis effects.  On such a slow \nflow, the Coriolis effects are overwhelmingly important. \n \nFurthermore, the magnetic forces are overwhelmingly important.  So it’s a combination of rotational \nand magnetic effects, all fitting together to confine the field, just in response to this downwelling.  \n[We called such flows confinement layers, by analogy with the classical boundary layers on, for instance, \naeroplane wings.]  And so that, I think, is going to be seen as an important part of the solution to the \nproblem, even though other work has to be done to check how that fits into the rest of the global-\nscale picture.  [Again, it’s like classical boundary layers seen as part of another jigsaw, the entire flow around \nan aeroplane.  We published a big and closely-argued paper on the confinement-layer dynamics, “Polar \nconfinement of the Sun's interior magnetic field by laminar magnetostrophic flow”,  J. Fluid Mech. 677, 445 \n(2011).] \n \nIn this work at any point, to what extent are you using observational data?   \n \nWell, of course, the quick answer is helioseismic data – the people who work with that data, and do \nall the complicated calculations to deduce that the interior rotates in a certain way, that is.  Those \nare the data involved.  And that’s pretty much it.  Of course we know other things about the Sun, \nsuch as its surface temperature, and, y’know, that’s old knowledge that’s been known for a long \ntime.  But you might say that those observations are part of the picture, ’cause they’re another part \nof what constrains our models of the Sun. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 245 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n245 \n[0:26:10] \n \nThank you.  And could you now describe recent work on the jet systems of Jupiter? \n \nYes.  Well, that’s been another recent interest.  The Sun and the Jupiter problem have been the two \nreasons why I have drifted rather away from the Earth’s stratosphere – apart from a feeling that I’ve \nprobably made my best contribution there, long ago.  But I have spoken of jets a few times and the \nfact that they... in the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans, they tend to sharpen themselves, and that \nthis is a sort of anti-frictional effect.  This is the very same point that I made about the Sun’s interior.  \nIf the jet keeps itself sharp it’s... the fastest moving fluid is not spreading out, the way it would under \nordinary friction.  And, okay, we have a pretty good idea of how the jets in the Earth’s atmosphere \nand ocean keep themselves sharp, and a lot of people have tended to think that other jet systems \nare similar. \n \n(One of them is actually inside fusion power machines.  This is rather surprising, but the big \nmachines that confine hot gases by magnetic fields – they’re called tokamaks, or the most important \nkind is called a tokamak – and there’s a hope that these machines might develop to give us \nenormous new low-carbon energy sources.  But it’s technically complicated.  One of the foundations \nof that hope is that there are jet-like flows inside those tokamaks, and that they help to keep the \nheat in, and make conditions more conducive to fusion power generation.  [There seems to be an \neddy-transport-barrier effect, perhaps somewhat like that of the polar-night jet at the edge of the ozone hole.]  \nAnd I was recently asked to give a lecture to an audience of plasma physicists [the Marshall Rosenbluth \nLecture], telling them what I knew about atmosphere–ocean jets.  I have to say, it’s not clear to me \nyet just how similar the tokamak jets are.   But, okay, so that’s one kind of jet system.) \n \nYet another... are the jets on Jupiter.  Anyone who’s seen those marvellous pictures of Jupiter’s \ncloud layer is aware that there are great jet streams, or currents, flowing eastward or westward.  \nAnd many people in my community tend to think that all these jet systems are terribly similar to \neach other.  And some people even think they’re all due to one particular mechanism; it’s called the \nRhines mechanism. \nMichael McIntyre Page 246 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n246 \n \nI actually tend to disagree with that idea.  There are actually several different mechanisms that can \ngenerate jets.  In fact, the nature of these systems is such that practically any disturbance will \ngenerate jets.  So it isn’t really clear that just because you have jets it must be one mechanism or \nanother.  But the thing that struck me about Jupiter, in recent years, is that, in contrast to the \nfamiliar [strong] jets in the ocean and atmosphere – where I think we do understand fairly well how \nthey work, in terms of mixing potential vorticity – the jets on Jupiter don’t meander.  They meander \nhardly at all.  They’re extremely straight [especially the eastward or prograde jets.].  They... almost \neverywhere, they flow almost exactly along latitude circles – even at high latitudes, we now know \nfrom the spacecraft observations.  The main exception to that statement is where they skirt around \nthe Great Red Spot, and one or two other big vortices.  But otherwise they’re remarkably straight, \nand very unlike terrestrial jets. \n \nSo that makes me think: almost certainly it’s a different mechanism, probably not PV mixing.  I’ve \nactually changed my mind about that in recent years.  And I’ve had two students working on this, \none a few years ago, who is driving me mad by not finishing his thesis [though we published a beautiful \ngeneral theorem together, in 2010].  But the other one I acquired just recently.  And we’re starting to \nwork on a new idea about the mechanism behind Jupiter’s jets, which I think is extremely promising.  \nAnd I don’t want to say much more about that, because it’s early days and it might or might not \nwork out.  But he’s started to play with a simple numerical model where you can test these ideas.  \nIt’s a good example of an intermediate level of modelling – not trying to simulate the whole planet.  \nEfforts to do that [at other research centres, including Oxford] are in their very early stages still.  And it’s \nvery difficult ’cause we don’t know enough about the planet’s interior, actually. \n \nBut this intermediate-modelling level, I think, is going to teach us quite a bit about how do you make \nstraight jets, using excitation mechanisms that are much more like the ones on Jupiter, particularly \nthe thunderstorms that are injected from below.  And we know there are thunderstorms on Jupiter.  \nThat’s very clear.  You can see the lightning.  You can see the tops of the [thunder]clouds, and all of \nthat.  And we know there’s enough water vapour there to get moist convection going – rather like \nyou have in the Earth’s atmosphere, especially in the tropics.  But it’s difficult to say more, because \nwe don’t have a good enough handle on the fluid dynamics yet.  And that’s what I’m going for with \nMichael McIntyre Page 247 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n247 \nthis new student [Stephen Thomson, who is now, in November 2013, making excellent progress with the \nproblem]. \n \n[0:31:35] \n \nYou have a personal website, and I wonder whether you could give us a potted history of the creation \nand development of that, including perhaps your motivations for starting it, as well as continuing it. \n \nWell, as I recall, the way it started – and this happened in the early days of the internet, shortly after \nit became possible to write web pages in simple HTML code – we had a computer bloke in the group \nwho showed us how to write such code, and what some of the conventions were.  And I realised that \nthat’s a good way to put up prepublication papers.  Before that, the usual thing would be to send \nwhat we call a preprint, a prepublication copy of a paper.  If I thought a paper of mine might interest \nsome colleagues, I would tend to xerox copies, and post them around the place.  When you think \nabout the carbon footprint of that these days you... rather terrifying [laughs]. \n \nBut that’s what everybody did.  So when the internet came along we realised that, well, the internet \ncould do that job for us, and it’s qu... nicer in a way.  You could... it would become well known that \nrecent publications would be on your website.  You’d just put it up, and if somebody were interested \nthey could look.  And if they weren’t, they needn’t bother.  So I started putting up prepublication \npapers on the website. \n \nAnd then... well, I realised it was a way to... I suppose it was an early form of blog.  I’m not quite sure \nwhat ‘blog’ means these days.  It often means an interactive site, where you say things on your blog, \nbut you’ve got... there’s a slot for people to come back and comment.  Well, this isn’t a blog in that \nsense, but it is a sort of place where... well, if you look at my home page it says, “an opportunity to \nallow the bees in one’s bonnet to buzz even more noisily than usual” [laughs], which is a quotation \nfrom Hermann Bondi’s wonderful Tarner Lectures. \nMichael McIntyre Page 248 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n248 \n \nAnd, well, I have a few bees in my bonnet about things like the scientific ideal and the scientific \nethic, and what good science is, and what’s going to be important in the future – including this \nbusiness about lucidity principles.  So in fact you can find my website by googling the exact phrase \n”lucidity principles”,  provided you spell ‘principles’ correctly and... [laughs].  It’s no good just doing \n‘lucidity’ because then you get all the lucid-dreaming stuff, which is wonderful stuff but irrelevant.  \nSo that’s one way to find my stuff.  You’ll find a little page on ‘lucidity principles [in brief’], a quick \nread on what I mean by that, based on perception psychology.  And at the bottom, back to my home \npage, and then you can go to my home page and you’ll see various things – some people might call \nthem rants, although I try to do it in a moderate tone – such as the business about carbon dioxide \nbeing a big input to the Earth-system amplifier, and how clear that is from paleoclimatology  [and \nsome undisputed physics and chemistry].  You can find that by looking for  [”lucidity principles” \nsimultaneously with] ”carbon dioxide”.  And of course you can find all sorts of publications and \npreprints still. \n \nIt’s all a bit haphazard, because maintaining a thing like that [in one old codger’s spare time] is \nsomething you’ve just got to do hand-to-mouth, as and when the opportunity arises.  So I’m afraid \nthe layout of the website is not especially lucid, and I apologise for that.  But since you can always \nuse a good search engine like google on that site (site, colon, url)  [e.g. ”carbon dioxide” \nsite:www.atm.damtp.cam.ac.uk/people/mem/],  it’s not hard to find things really. \n \nAnd of course, because of its haphazard growth, one of the problems with it is that there are \nprobably things buried in there – needles in the whole haystack – that would give copyright lawyers \nnightmares, and administrators nightmares.  So what you can be quite sure of is that the website as \na whole is never going to be transferred to any official archive like DSpace.  And what you can also \nbe sure of is that I’m not going to go through the haystack, and try and pull out everything that \nmight be okay for copyright, and put that into DSpace, ’cause there’s a huge bureaucratic hassle – \nwell, not only doing that, but actually determining what is copyright and what isn’t, because in \nprinciple almost everything is.  You can’t sing Happy Birthday to someone without violating \ncopyright, you realise.  It’s a copyright tune. \n \nMichael McIntyre Page 249 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n249 \nSo actually the resources to go into that, and sort out that problem, simply aren’t available to me.  I \ndon’t have the millions of dollars I’d have to pay the copyright lawyers.  And even if I did pay them, \nthey probably wouldn’t come up with a clear answer as to what’s safe and what isn’t.  So there you \nare.  In the academic world, we have reasonable rules of ‘fair use’ where we say, if it’s for research \nand personal edification, on the whole it’s okay to reproduce things [in small chunks], provided you \nacknowledge them properly – and that, of course, I try to do. \n \nFor instance, in the Lucidity papers there is a copyright tune; but there is a rule that says [that quoting \nit is] ‘fair use’.  It’s Oh What a Beautiful Morning, actually.  Because I’m illustrating organic change, \naren’t I?  It’s a nice illustration of how organic change works in music.  It’s familiar to everyone.  And \nI actually paid $100 for the permission to publish it originally.  But now the papers are on my \nwebsite, and I’m not really sure whether that... but there is this fair-use rule.  I did go into this.  As \nfar as I could tell, from publications on copyright, it’s okay to quote a short piece of music, without \npaying anything, so long as it’s for research purposes or scholarly purposes, and not reproducing the \nwhole thing and making money out of it – which I’m certainly not doing.  So I think that’s probably \nokay, although I’m sure there’s a lawyer somewhere who might argue that it isn’t.  Anyway, right \nnow you can get those papers off my website.  You can also get them off the journal site because, in \ntheir infinite wisdom, they’ve made them open-access, I’m very pleased to see. \n \nBut if you get my copies off my website you’ll get them with some handwritten corrections and extra \nannotations, which you might like to have.  And there are many other things like that.  So what I \nreally hope will happen is that enough people will find my website interesting enough to want to \nmirror it, ’cause if enough people mirror it, then basically it becomes... it’s outside the reach of the \nbureaucrats, and it’s available to posterity.  So please, dear listener, if you think there’s anything \ninteresting there, that’s worth mirroring, do so, just copy all the files on to another computer.  By \nthe time you hear this, it’ll be dirt cheap to do this, because of Moore’s Law.  So please feel free to \ngo ahead.   I’m  just interested in communicating things I’ve discovered, and giving them to people to \nmake use of. \n \n[0:38:30] \nMichael McIntyre Page 250 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n250 \n \nAnd on the... if you do go... by googling “lucidity principles”, you’ll see an animation of a... well, \nperhaps you could describe it and say what it is. \n \nWell, I call it the ‘walking lights’.  This is a great classic in experimental psychology.  You see twelve \nmoving dots, but everyone with normal vision who looks at these moving dots sees a person \nwalking.  And that tells you quite a number of things, I think.  One thing it tells you is that perception \nworks by model-fitting  [as discussed earlier].  The [unconscious] brain is doing what statisticians call a \nBayesian-inference operation – or something pretty like it. \n \nThere are actually some beautiful theorems that tell you that Bayesian inference is optimal.  [There’s \na little essay on this entitled “On thinking probabilistically” on my home page ; the theorems are due to Richard \nThrelkeld Cox.]  And therefore natural selection is likely to have built it into our brains.  But, in one \nway or another, those twelve moving dots are being interpreted by our brains as a certain kind of \nthree-dimensional, piecewise-rigid motion.  The brain has built an internal model of that three-\ndimensional motion, and is fitting it to those data.  So, perception works by model-fitting; if you \nunderstand that, you understand [as suggested earlier] a hell of a number of things about... other \nthings about how perception works, and, you know, [for instance] identity... mistaken identity in the \nlaw courts [remembering that the perceived reality is the internal model].  There’s a huge number of \nthings that are illuminated by that insight.  You can also understand a lot about how music works, \nwhich interests me, and you can understand how to develop better communication skills, which is \npart of the point about ‘lucidity principles’.  [Sorry, I said most of that earlier.  Must be getting tired!] \n \nThe other thing that this animation teaches us, or reminds us of, is this business of perceptual \nsensitivity to organically-changing patterns.  The walking lights is a good example of an organically-\nchanging pattern.  Some things are changing, more or less continuously in this case, and other things \nstay the same – such as the number of limbs, and the number of dots.  In fact if you watch... and \npsychologists have done a lot of work on this – if you suddenly take away some of the dots, you feel \na sort of jolt, a discontinuity, but you... if you don’t... if you can leave enough of them there [visible], \nyou still see a person walking, as if suddenly somebody suddenly covered up the image, or part of it.  \nSo that’s a jump away from organic change; and we’re sensitive to when that happens as well. \nMichael McIntyre Page 251 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n251 \n \nWhat else is invariant?  Well, the model you’re fitting to the moving dots has invariant features, such \nas the distances between the principal joints.  It’s a piecewise rigid motion of a certain kind of \nstructure.  So there you are.  Organic change, as I said before, is important to our ancestors’ survival.  \nBeing sensitive to that means you can tell that you’re in the path of a charging rhinoceros.  That’s an \norganically changing pattern, isn’t it.  The number of legs is invariant; the shape has all sorts of \ninvariant features – but all sorts of [other] things are changing,  and you’d better get out of the way \nquickly, hadn’t you.  Ahead of conscious thought [laughs]. \n \n[0:41:28] \n \nAre there places that a listener might go to consult non-digital materials?  In other words, do you \nhave any... have you already or do you have plans to put paper records anywhere for future use? \n \nYes, to some extent, although I realise these days things on the internet are the most important \narchive, and so I’ve tended to focus on trying to make that the main effort.  But okay, when you get \ninto the Royal Society, the society does ask you to deposit some biographical stuff in their library – \nwhich is still on my list of things to do, I’m ashamed to say [laughs].  But I do... if I don’t get \nAlzheimer’s first, I will probably do that at some point.  So yeah, it’s always worth asking in the \nlibrary. \n \nAnd what about letters and, I don’t know, drafts and that sort of thing?  What will happen with \nthem? \n \nWell, my old correspondence is in a state of chaos.  If somebody would like to collect what there is \nof my old correspondence, it’s sitting there in the filing cabinets.  I wouldn’t mind... I suppose I could \njust bung it all off to the Royal Society and say, there it is, chuck it out or make what you will of it.  So \nthat might survive.  I’ll have to move out of this office sometime, and I’m sure a lot of the papers in it \nMichael McIntyre Page 252 \nC1379-72 \nTrack 8 \n \n252 \nare just going to be chucked into the recycling bin.  But, you know, old letters – who knows, \nsomebody might be interested.  I don’t know. \n \nI mean, if somebody... you have to, well, probably attain a level of eminence or greatness greater \nthan mine, before somebody’s going to spend years looking through old papers.  Er, I... it’s not for \nme to say whether anybody might find it interesting, but I’m happy for somebody to look through it, \nyou know, especially after I’m too old to care myself [laughs]. \n \n[0:43:24] \n \nAnd finally, could you say something about how you’ve found being interviewed for National Life \nStories and the experience of it?  And you can answer that imagining I’m not here, if necessary.  But, \nyou know, how you found the process. \n \nOh well, it’s always... well basically it’s been fun.  It’s fun to have your memories jogged about early \nparts of your career you haven’t thought about for ages.  And it’s always a valuable exercise to have \nto try and say how significant your work is [and why], in lay terms.  I mean, Lord Rutherford always \nused to say this to his research students, “If you can’t explain your work to your wife it is valueless.”  \nWell, with rather technical work like mine, that’s a little bit tricky.  But it’s still useful to try, I think.  \nSo whether I’ve achieved it or not is up to the listener to judge [laughs].  But there you go.  No, no, \nno, I’ve found it a positive experience, and of course I’m very honoured that the British Library \nshould want to bother to have anything about me at all.  So thank you [laughs]. \n \n[End of Transcript] \n \n \n"
